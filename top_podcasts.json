My grandfather Don Basham wrote many books about spiritual topics and my father Glenn Basham granted me a very artistic atmosphere of classical music in the home I was raised and homeschooled in. I spent about 15 years total traveling all throughout Asia and learning both Japanese and Chinese as well as a myriad of other topics. Now I'm excited to share these discoveries with you together with my beautiful wife, Jennifer Rimel-Basham. paypal: jenniferrimel@hotmail.com Email us at: bashasham@gmail.com",

Traditional marriage counseling, couples therapy, couples counseling and even Christian marriage counseling will tell you that a good marriage is based on compromise. Validating feelings. Sacrifice. I tried that for years. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why most couples who go through marriage counseling are the same or worse off after. BUT, in my studies in neuroscience at BYU, MD training at UCLA, psychiatry residency, marriage coach training, and most importantly in my own marriage, I finally found what DOES work. Building strength. Spiritual, mental, emotional and sexual strength, while anchored in following Christian marriage principles. Strength is attractive. And, it feels great. It builds trust. Add to this the skills of communication and intimacy, and you get a marriage full of phenomenal mental, emotional and physical intimacy. And, you set the example for generations to follow. I applied this to my own marriage, I felt better than ever and had more connection and passion than I thought possible. I started teaching this to other men and couples and they were able to create mental, emotional and sexual intimacy faster than they thought possible. This even works for affair recovery and emotional affairs. Now it\u2019s your turn. Become a strong, attractive man. Create a strong, passionate marriage.</p>",

        "description": "The Diddy Diaries: The Downfall of Sean Combs is a raw, unflinching look at the dramatic collapse of one of hip-hop\u2019s biggest moguls. For decades, Sean 'Diddy' Combs seemed untouchable\u2014a figure who rose from the streets to become a titan of the music, fashion, and entertainment industries. His Bad Boy Entertainment label defined a generation of hip-hop, and his entrepreneurial spirit made him a household name. But beneath the surface of this glittering success lay darker currents\u2014currents that have now surged into the spotlight as the empire he built threatens to crumble beneath the weight of scandal and serious criminal allegations.<br /><br />This podcast dives deep into the allegations that have sent shockwaves through the entertainment world. At the center of it all are the accusers\u2014those who have come forward with shocking claims of misconduct, manipulation, and abuse. These aren\u2019t just sensational headlines\u2014they are stories that expose a side of Sean Combs the public never saw. The Diddy Diaries explores how these accusations began to surface, what drove his accusers to finally speak out, and how the legal system has responded.<br /><br />But this isn\u2019t just about Diddy\u2019s public image taking a hit\u2014The Diddy Diaries zeroes in on the high-stakes battle that Diddy now faces to stay out of jail. Each episode unpacks the legal drama as it unfolds in real-time: the charges, the court proceedings, and the fight for his freedom. Once a man who had it all\u2014fame, fortune, and influence\u2014Diddy now stands at the center of a legal storm that threatens to strip him of everything, including his freedom.<br /><br /><br />We trace the events that led up to this moment, looking at how Diddy\u2019s larger-than-life persona masked a pattern of behavior that would ultimately bring him to this point. Listeners will get a front-row seat to the high-stakes legal battles, where the possibility of incarceration looms large. The tension is palpable as Diddy\u2019s legal team works to combat the mounting evidence against him, while his accusers push for justice.<br /><br />Through riveting storytelling, The Diddy Diaries paints a full picture of Diddy\u2019s downfall, from the heights of his stardom to the depths of his legal fight for survival. This is not a story about maintaining power or influence\u2014it\u2019s a fight to avoid the ultimate consequence: prison. As the allegations mount and the legal drama intensifies, The Diddy Diaries delivers a compelling narrative of a man grappling with the very real possibility of losing everything he once held dear.<br /><br />With every episode, listeners are drawn deeper into this unfolding saga of celebrity, power, and justice. The Diddy Diaries not only explores the high-profile case but also delves into the human cost behind the headlines. As Diddy\u2019s world unravels, so too does the carefully constructed image he spent decades building. This podcast is a must-listen for anyone who wants to understand the full scope of Sean Combs\u2019 downfall, where the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher and the outcome remains uncertain.<br /><br />Prepare for a rollercoaster ride through the most shocking and consequential scandal in recent entertainment history.
