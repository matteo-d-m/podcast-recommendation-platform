        "description": "Brad and Ryan Knight, affectionately known as The Brothers of Basketball, are lifelong Indiana Pacers fans turned podcast hosts who bring heart, humor, and hoops knowledge to The Pacers Post Up, a show built entirely by fans, for fans.\n\nBrad\u2019s love for the Pacers dates back to the Reggie Miller era\u2014the legendary playoff heroics, the fierce Eastern Conference Finals battles, and the team\u2019s lone trip to the NBA Finals in 2000 are part of his basketball DNA. He still vividly remembers watching the Malice at the Palace unfold in his parents\u2019 living room. That deep-rooted connection only grew over the years. Brad\u2019s wife has been a Pacemate for 8 seasons, and he credits their parents\u2019 investment in season tickets as a key part of the family\u2019s shared bond with the Blue and Gold.\n\nRyan, a few years younger, missed the height of the Reggie era but became fully indoctrinated during the Paul George years\u2014when the Pacers battled LeBron and the Heat year after year. A proud member of the G2 Fan Zone in the late 2010s and the world\u2019s biggest Lance Stephenson fan, Ryan brings unapologetic energy and passion to the pod.\n\nTogether, Brad and Ryan launched The Pacers Post Up as a passion project to give Pacers fans a voice in the media landscape. Their goal has always been to deliver meaningful basketball conversation in a way that\u2019s accessible, insightful, and fun. Whether diving into analytics and X\u2019s and O\u2019s or riding high on the emotional wave of a big win, their show strikes a balance that keeps fans informed and entertained.\n\nSince launching, the brothers have followed the team from Vegas (for the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament) to Paris (for the NBA Global Games), covered the All-Star Weekend in Indy, and chronicled this new golden era of Pacers basketball with playoff runs to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThey bleed blue and gold and love nothing more than building community through the game that\u2019s meant so much to their lives.",
