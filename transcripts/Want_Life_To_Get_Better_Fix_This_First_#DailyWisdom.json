" If you want to make use of the full scope of this body and this brain,  of this human possibility, of this consciousness that we refer to as human being,  then first thing is this, that you understand and fix it within you absolutely.  The quality of my life is entirely my making and nobody else and nobody else.  You fix this one thing. Balance will come. Once balance comes,  I am impatient to take you to places where only people with balance can walk or this cannot."
