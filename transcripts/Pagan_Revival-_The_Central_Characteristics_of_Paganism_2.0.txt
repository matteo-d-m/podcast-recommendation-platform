 O Lord of hosts, me with us, for we are none other help, in terms of adversity, but the  O Lord of hosts and mercy are none others.  Paganism 2.0 is this mixture of the revival of ancient value systems.  Again, as we talk about some of the central characteristics and practices of paganism,  we can see things like ecstatic forms of spirituality, ritual inebriation, of the privileging  of magic, various forms of sexual orientation, the expression of transgenderism, temple prostitution,  the celebration of prostitution to some degree.  We can look at human sacrifice, which I would, in my worldview as an Orthodox Christian,  certainly, associate with the conversation regarding abortion, regarding depopulation, one of the  things about the depopulation movement is that we have too many people on this planet, and  what's happening is that we are than choking mother earth, the guy of herself, which is  comes to a sort of personification of earth that's very common in the Western world, it's  tied with concepts of the guy of hypothesis by James Lovelock, which is in for him to be fair,  was not as explicit that guy or the earth itself was a sort of a conscious personality,  he's talking about it more and sort of a regulating energy system, but this has been adopted  by contemporary paganism to often talk about earth as guy of mother earth, as we'll see in  the Apple commercial mother nature. Now, Apple as a company and again, I, all my products are  Apple, I sort of bought into the Apple ecosystem, if you will, it's just the easiest for me with my  laptop, my desktop, my phone. But the symbol of the Apple with a bite taken out of it is indicative  of the fall of man, right, the tree of knowledge, and it's sort of a nostic turn on it that the  computer in a way is a celebration of our pursuit to be God like through our technology. So it's interesting  that the fall with our understanding from a Christian perspective is certainly tied with a degeneration  into the sort of pagan values and pagan religion and nature religion and all this stuff. Now,  I want to be clear, us as Christians, we believe that we as mankind are the stewards of creation.  We hold creation in an elevated sense. We believe it's beautiful. It's good. We want it to be prosperous.  We want to protect it, but we do not personify it. And this is the difference between a sort of pagan  worldview and a Christian worldview and how we relate to it is that we do not personify  nature because we in fact are the epitome of nature. We are the pinnacle. We are the top because we have the  amagodate. We're made in the energy, we'll in the image of God and we can participate in the uncreated  energies of God, like logic, like reason, like love, conscious love, the liberate love, loving somebody who doesn't  choose the love you. This is different than the animal kingdom. This is different than a mammal,  female caring for her young, which we see in nature, but nature and animals are not participating in  mercy and compassion and these higher faculties that we would argue are unique to humans. So,  the central characteristic, let's get into some of the central characteristics of paganism. One of them  is that it emphasizes the worship of earth and it usually embodies natural world or the physical universe  as a personified understandings of gods and goddesses. And so typically, it is explicitly polytheistic.  If you look in and then again, preparation for day stream, I was looking at various pagan websites  and how they describe their own faith and one of the things I found on multiple sites is their explicit  rejection of monotheism. We have discussed people just like in what our last stream was on Terrence  McKinnon. Terrence McKinnon also bought into this worldview that the male dominator ego was tied  with the development of monotheism and the understanding of God as male or using male pronouns. And we've  seen even the Church of England, the Anglican Church talk about for again social justice, for a lot of  the contemporary rhetoric around those things that God, they're going to start using female pronouns,  or they then pronouns to refer to God. This has to do with this pagan presupposition essentially  that the monotheistic religions are male-dominated in as it turns McKinnon would talk about a sort of  ego-domination and that it wants to dominate the world and submit everything to its own will, which  certainly an over-dramatization of that I would argue but the pagan worldview is characterized  by sort of polytheism, which they see as more of an expressive form of spirituality that allows for,  like I said, multiple gender expressions. You can look into if you're not familiar with the cults  of Ishatar or Anana and it's very common that some of the priestess there would actually be  transgender women, so it would be men who would then either become unix or maybe they would keep their  genitalia but dress in a way that would present themselves as female in the female. Some of the  females would actually then present themselves as males. So it's not uncommon and I actually have a thing  just looking up for today's stream that there's multiple examples of transgenderism within  pagan spirituality. Now there's also explicit examples in which paganism rejects transgenderism  and sometimes even homosexuality but generally speaking it was much more accommodating to these things  and I would argue when we get into the section on the philosophical breakdown on paganism that it's  because paganism is inherently relativistic. Now you could point to things like Plato and of course  Socrates and Plato were actually critical of the polytheistic religion of the Greek at their time.  This is part why Socrates had a drink the in vain, right? That's why he had a die in the court because  he was converting the youth or again giving a sort of critical presentation of the Greek gods.  So Socrates and Plato now Plato we would is he Christian is he of monotheists maybe you could kind  of understand his understanding of the ultimate good as a sort of monotheism but the way he's not  relativistic like typical forms of paganism is that he roots objectivity in the ideal forms which is  something that most monotheisms are going to do and they're going to have a philosophically a more coherent  worldview than that of these pagan traditions which are typically locally oriented and then it's  brooding gods and goddesses as personifications of natural events nature itself. So how can you say  that Odin is better than Zeus? Well you can't what happens is the tribes go to war and whoever wins  therefore gives credit to their pagan gods that those pagan gods then are superior.  So some of the central characteristics of paganism is one that it worships the earth and it personifies  natural phenomenon as gods and goddesses. There is no official universal doctrine and this is part of the  relativism of it is that paganism itself and I mean it not in regards to yes I understand the Roman  understanding is like rural people not participating in the Christian religions but now in the contemporary  period scholars refer to nature worship as paganism. So that's what I'm referring to here obviously and  paganism like I said has no official doctrine across all its traditions it has a few central characteristics  that define it and those are like the rejection almost a universal rejection of monotheism. Now there are a  few historical examples in which pagan traditions would identify as like a supreme deity within a pantheon  of various deities but generally speaking even according to contemporary pagans they would say  one of their central characteristics is the rejection of monotheism and specifically they highlight  first Christianity and then Judaism and Islam. So the Abrahamic traditions also contemporary  paganism places a great emphasis on ecological issues as central to their spirituality in the relationship  to the ultimate which would be a sort of this pantheon of various deities. So when we look at the  global climate change I'm an article which I think is fair to say is that we're witnessing the growth of a  new religion that global climate change even the transgender LGBTQ movement in a way this is a sort of  new religion because it has to do with the ultimate concern the ultimate authority for various groups and  peoples. So this again is another central characteristic is that for contemporary pagans and I mean  basically there was a pagan revival in the 1960s with the counter culture along with the sort of growth and  popularization of Eastern mysticism this was due to so many various Asian ethnicities and groups of  people coming to the western world able to talk about their Dharma religions, Taoism, various forms of  Buddhism, this types of things. So the sixties is one of we see then the growth of Judaism,  Wica, all these various forms of paganism of which I said these ecological concerns play a central  importance for them and when we look at this apple commercial I'd say again this is part and parcel of the  exact same thing. So another characteristic is that the majority of pagan traditions believed in a form  of reincarnation and there is a book that I actually read on contemporary Catholics in America in one of  the surprising things that I saw it was like between 40 and 50% of Catholics this this was a survey done  they themselves believed in reincarnation and so reincarnation has an understanding of how we  what happens after we die. Well it's a growing belief system and this is another characteristic  general characteristic of paganism again we'll be able to find examples in which that's not the case  but many believe that you would reincarnate even Pythagoras believed in a sort of trans  trans migration of the soul but many pagans would see that depending on how you live your life,  how in favor you are of the various gods that you couldn't reincarnate as an animal you could reincarnate  as a tree or you can reincarnate as another person with another opportunity of some sort now it's a  little bit different than Hinduism in the Darmic religions but certainly that reincarnation  dimension is present. Practices in paganism may include like I said ritual neibriation typically  paganism does not understand neibriation as any sort of sinful thing now this is another thing in  which they would highlight as a detriment to the monotheisms because Judaism is long and Christianity  would view a neibriation as some type of sin to put it that way within a Christian context now of  course I understand that there's mystical traditions such as Kabbalah which would engage in  ritual neibriation, Sufi's regarding his sheesh and cannabis ingestion but generally speaking  the orthodox of these faiths would not would not promote ritual neibriation and this is something that we  can see pretty consistent among historical examples of paganism also we see the relationship to sex  so group sex polyamory having multiple sexual partners polygamy having multiple wives in a sort  of pagan ritual of marriage fairly common also potential examples of ritualistic orgeastic activity so  as I said we still know of examples of civilizations in the Amazon for example but many of theorize  such some of the pagan groups of the ancient Middle East and Mediterranean that they would  engage in sort of full moon orgees and this is as I highlighted in my last dream that some of the  psychedelic community or the new age community but Terence McKenna would celebrate as that it would  sort of obfuscate male paternity because again you can highlight that monotheism that you can highlight  that male or as we call the phylogocentasm of Christianity wanting to understand and know male  paternity this is the whole lineage of Abraham right this is the promise of God to Abraham so  ritualistic sex and I mean that we see in pagan tradition like temple prostitutes I did a whole  stream discussing the history of temple prostitutes which include often men who present themselves as women  and women who present themselves as men that would engage in these sort of sexual rituals also  human sacrifice not uncommon at all multiple scholars have looked into human sacrifice and of course  the almost all their examples exist within a pagan context the druids being a very explicit example  in which they were very open but you can look at for example the Aztecs a group that they would perform  their sacrifices to their gods in which they would offer people of their own community but often people  that were captured or rival tribes to their gods for blessings this human sacrifice you know is I would say  still present in this contemporary pagan 2.0 with abortion with the sterility movement I mean we see  that the fear of death due to the coup from 2020 certainly prompted a lot of people to get the  jab which has caused a lot of people to unfortunately experience a lot of ill health effects many people  have been passed away through it we'll say just to be politically correct here and not not to be too  conspiratorial as they say right so human sacrifice cannibalism I have a whole thing here on some of the  contemporary like Richard Dawkins a note where the atheist famous for his arguing against Christians talking  about how talking about how we should actually eat human grab lab grown meat some people think I'm making  this up I'm not actually show you this article right here so here it is so again why would you eat human  meat grown in a lab controversial scientists Richard Dawkins exists it could eradicate the taboo against  cannibalism and of course they they cite that we need to stop eating meat as to save the planet right so veganism  is something that emerges quite often regards to this paganism 2.0 that we need to save the planet  how well we do so by stop eating meat we can become vegans we can become vegetarians or as  even Richard Dawkins is highlighting we if you want to eat meat you can just eat your own human lab grown meat  well again maybe he doesn't think of it this way but I would certainly see it as an Orthodox Christian that this is a  degeneration back to a sort of pagan worldview in which cannibalism was acceptable multiple groups  again you can look at pop in the guinea you can look at the mehori tribes in New Zealand  where ritual cannibalism wasn't unheard of even within the ancient Middle East it wasn't unheard of  of like the the sitians in various tribes nomadic peoples that when they dominated a certain group in  in battle that they would eat the flesh of the person to demonstrate their dominance and whatever  positive characteristics that person or that enemy had will that the the the victorious tribe would  now be able to gain acquire those those virtues another general characteristic is that they have no  concept of sin and virtuous suffering so pagan religion generally speaking is not going to be so  adamant about this objective moral framework and how we align ourselves with God and this is why  again there is no there is no universal doctrine in paganism because there is no emphasis on any  objective moral understanding you the way you align with with your deities is through sacrifice now it to be  animals sacrifice as I said humans sacrifice quite often in the Bible we can see bail for example in  molock and how the Jews continue to fall victim to sacrificing their first born for these blessings from  these pagan gods and I think people now are sacrificing themselves in various ways that I think are totally  consistent with the the ancient practices but what I would call paganism 2.0 now paganism 2.0 is undoing  I would argue the remnants of Christianity left in western civilization this is why it seems like it's a  new thing or that it's a novel thing or that it's a beneficial aspect to our society because even though  as we'll get into the philosophical dimension paganism is generally relativistic when it comes to morals and  ethics and epistemology well they use the rhetoric of objectivity and objective morals to talk about social  justice and climate change and why you need to you know own nothing in love it as according to the  World Economic Forum that you will own nothing and you will be happy you will love it  well they use this sort of rhetoric of objectivity to promote their their world view and I would say the  bringing forth of of of of of general the the mass acceptance of homosexuality of of transgenderism  of the idea of radical forms of feminism that people aren't having children anymore that people aren't  getting married anymore in a way this is a paganism 2.0 this is a paganism that is novel and new  but is again undoing the remnants left of Christianity in our culture and that paganism 2.0 again is all about  saving guy saving mother earth and it's in this attempt to save mother earth it says that it needs the  depopulate and this is almost consistent among anybody who believes this stuff and that's why you should  be sterile that's probably why you shouldn't have children there's a whole anti-natalist movement talking  about why you shouldn't have children and that if you do have children well that means that you're you're  you're basically bad for the planet you're too obsessed with your own desires and you don't care about people  you're not virtuous you're not virtuous now from a Christian world view that's what we're called to  we're called to marriage we're called to sacrifice our will to unite with somebody else and we're  called to be fruitful in anybody who's ever been born on this planet what's given the right to be born  by God not by anybody else so or not by you know not not like this is um accident waiting to happen this is how  it's kind of presented today I believe that if there's eight billion people here God clearly once  all those people to be here and many scientists have argued that hey there we have plenty of resources  that we can feed everybody but this is part of the rhetoric of this paganism 2.0 and so pagan values are  spread now through the modern technology and this gets into a central dimension of my premise today is  the global village Marshall McLuhan's understanding of what digital technology we're going to do to our  society and that it was going to revert us back to a primitive state if again if I bring bring this back  up we can see it oh we can see it here let's see oh there we go that the global village  Marshall McLuhan who was a Canadian thinker coined the term global village in the 1960s  it indicates the daily production and consumption of media images and content by global audiences  McLuhan views the re-tribalization of Western society are prefigured in American anthropologist Edward  safebears 1933 article communication in which he wrote the multiplication of far-reaching techniques of  communication as two important results in the first place and increases the sheer radius of communication  so that for certain purposes the whole civilized world has made a psychological equivalent of a primitive  tribe and that's where you get into McLuhan's work which I have a video we're going to watch real  quick where he talks about the world is a global village but he's highlighting how he believed that the  digital technologies were going to revert us back to a pagan worldview now McLuhan was famous for trying to  not put value judgments into his work but he was a faithful Catholic who converted it as an adult  in the beginning of his academic career and so privately he was very concerned about this  privately he was much more in favor of a literate society and he'd even tied the Bible and the people of  the books which include the Abrahamic faiths that this was something that he believed was more beneficial for  society and it involves more a more formalism right so we can see this now on the way people dress  you go to the you go to the store and people are in their pajama pants and flip flops and they look like they  just crawled out of bed they their hair is messed up there is no formalism look at the way we talk to  people look at the way we dress formalism has totally been lost in our society and you can I would argue  at least that it has to do with again this pagan effect through the technology altering our sensory  ratios making us more and more like pre-literate people so philosophically when we look at paganism  like I said soccerty somebody that viewed themselves as incredibly rational saw the idea the  personification of natural events as gods and goddesses as irrational and I would argue that that is the  case it is irrational and so the inherently relativistic nature of paganism is something that would be  contrary again to a monotheistic worldview or explicitly a Christian worldview which we do have  an objective basis for epistemology we do have an explicit understanding of our metaphysics we do have  an objective understanding of morality and yes it has to do with revelation but then it has to do with  philosophical categories and being able to just philosophically justify these things I posted a real recently  on Sam Harris and it was amazing how upset so many atheists got it literally we're trying to  argue for relativism and stating it as if it's a objective fact I mean this is the breakdown in the  mind this is why so many people think that a man can become a woman how can you tell me I'm wrong by  yelling at the again the Christians of the audience that oh my god don't you understand morals  are culturally constructed there is no such thing as objective truth well if that's true then you  aren't right and the inability to see this I think is the is a breakdown one in our education system which is  quite an obvious at this point but people just don't have the sophistication to look and appreciate  the things that we were given and so we can feel something moving changing dramatically on our culture and  I would say it's it's the loss of so many things that we have taken for granted like the objective morale  and the objective ethics that we hold ourselves to and so you see all these videos on social media,  TikTok, Instagram where these people are like oh my gosh I don't feel safe in San Francisco anymore this  guy came up to me and hit me you know she had blood on her face and he stole my purse okay but you voted for  this you you believed in the world view that allowed for these things you condone them you disagree  with the people who promoted a worldview in which we needed to limit these things and promote a more  traditional understanding of morals and ethics so that we can have a civilized world again a  primitive tribe is pre civilized and I think that anybody watching civilization right now in the west we're  seeing it become more and more uncivilized I don't think that's a crazy thing to say at this point  so at least platenism at least grounds objectivity in the universal ideals and this is something that I at least  gave credit to with Terrence McKinna even though he identified himself as basically a shamanistic  relativistic worldview however he I also identified as a platenist and because he identified as a  platenist he was able to have some sort of objectivity in his world view although I would say it wasn't  totally consistent because he also argued for the transgression of these male-dominator ego cultures or  Christian morality in ethics but paganism grounds god in the materialistic world again it's inherently  relativistic it's an inherently local spirituality but you can look at platenism in the neoplatenism  neoplatenism I think is probably the epitome the pinnacle of paganism if you will although neoplatenism isn't  polytheistic it's explicitly a sort of monotheism and neoplatenism is a very eradite spirituality  although it's embedded within a sort of magical worldview of theology and performing various rituals to  access god and move closer to the ultimate one the monad but the way that paganism is emerging in the  21st century paganism 2.0 you're seeing it one with the radical left which is about the  sort of he's hedonistic trends of ancient paganism but we're also seeing it in the radical right I mean  the the white supremacist movement these types of people who identify you know that are there  are racialist and the sense that that's the only thing that's important they worship Odin they you know  they do the Roman salute and yet it fundamentally at a philosophical level it breaks down it's not able to  justify universal categories universal understanding objective epistemology of objective morals and ethics  and so it uses this ethical rhetoric to talk about social justice and climate change and why you  ought to do something but I would argue paganism 2.0 is partly in parcel why it was a growth in the  1960s moving forward is to the postmodern turn in epistemology the postmodern turn in philosophy rejects  universal claims it rejects what they call universal narratives universal themes universal categories  all for your own personal experience you yourself have the truth you have your own truth that's  what they claim and so the postmodern breakdown in epistemology allows for the return of this pagan  relativism in which everybody has led as the ancient paganism is about rather than a understanding of  sin and suffering it's about the pursuit of pleasure joy in a celebration of life now as Christians we  also celebrate life but we understand due to our understanding and our theology of the fall that there  is a inherent suffering and if anybody went to church the day at an Orthodox parish if you're on  the western calendar as I am the gospel reading was Christ telling people to carry your cross carry your own  cross the idea that we actually move closer to God through our suffering in this world this is not anything that  would be indicative of a pagan world view because the idea is to avoid the suffering and pursue the pleasure  the joy in the celebration of life you can look at the bacchanalian type festivals and the  Dionysian festivals these are in a way even though people want to claim Dionysius or Christ was a type of  Dionysius no there's again explicit inversions there and one of the ideas is that we would get  richly liberated or pursue ecstasy and that's my point is paganism is about the pursuit of ecstasy and  so you look at paganism 2.0 in our culture and drug culture and the acceptance of drugs in multiple ways  well this is again part and parcel of these ancient practices and so McLuhan in his global village I think is  really really insightful because it's through companies like Microsoft and Apple where these pagan values are  being spread and the global village is coming into fruition and we can see this I talked about before that  when I went to Germany and Greece this past summer that one of the things that I noticed explicitly was that the  gin zirs that they all had the same culture that my my nieces are gin zirs that my nieces the  oldest or are fraternal twins and there are seniors in high school right now and I'm very familiar with  what they're into the fashions the trends the things that they get so the the shoes the jeans the all the  fashion that they're participating in when I went to Germany that's exactly what I saw with the  gin zee when I went to Greece that's exactly what I saw with the gin zee they're participating in a new global  culture through the social media and I think this is indicative with McLuhan's theories of the global  village and it reverts people back as he argued to a primitive tribal worldview a tribal orientation of our  sensory ratios in which things are going to become again more archaic and we can see look at the acceptance  look at how gin zee 21% I believe in the United States identifies LGBTQ whereas just the millennials it was like  2 to 5% dramatic dramatic increase dramatic dramatic dramatic increase so the digital technologies are  changing our senses they're changing our desires and they're changing our values and that's why  when we watch this commercial from Apple it totally makes sense to me I don't think this is this is a  mystery at all and it makes the companies like Apple the leaders in the alteration of our value  system and the movement towards this paganism 2.0
