  "text": "The word ‘serverless’ is misleading. Servers are still there, humming in data centers, but the abstraction is moved away from the developer. You no longer patch, scale, or babysit machines—you just write functions that respond to events.\n\nThis shift matters because it democratizes scale. A small startup can suddenly run workloads that auto-scale to millions of requests, paying only for compute time. But there are trade-offs: cold starts can delay responses, and debugging distributed ephemeral functions is harder.\n\nThink of it as moving from owning a car to calling a ride-share. You don’t worry about oil changes, but you also lose some control. The art is knowing when serverless accelerates you, and when it shackles you.",
