    "text": "Everyone knows the MVP—the Minimum Viable Product. But what about the MLP: Minimum Lovable Product? This idea shifts focus from what barely works to what sparks delight. The truth is that functional products can still fail if users feel no connection.\n\nImagine two apps that both let you schedule meetings. One is clunky, the other greets you with a charming microinteraction when you confirm a time. Both solve the same problem, but only one earns loyalty. That’s the MLP difference.\n\nDesigners should therefore ask: what is the smallest feature set that still creates a memorable first impression? The MLP doesn’t ignore speed to market—it just ensures the early product also builds emotional resonance. A lovable product turns users into advocates, not just adopters.",
