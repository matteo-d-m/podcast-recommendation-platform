  "text": "We love the myth of the startup born in a garage. From HP to Apple, the story suggests that humble beginnings guarantee greatness. But survivorship bias hides the truth: thousands of garage projects die unnoticed.\n\nWhat really matters isn’t the garage, but the ecosystem around it: access to capital, mentorship, and timing. The garage is a symbol of scrappiness, but it’s not a formula.\n\nWhen we strip away the myth, we can celebrate innovation wherever it happens—whether in co-working spaces, dorm rooms, or yes, sometimes garages.",
