  "text": "Long before COVID-19, the world fought pandemics that reshaped societies. The plague of Justinian in the 6th century killed millions, weakening the Byzantine Empire. Yet few remember it compared to the Black Death.\n\nHistory tends to spotlight certain crises while leaving others in the margins. The forgotten plague shows us how fragile supply chains, trade routes, and political alliances were centuries ago. Contemporary chronicles describe empty cities and leaders resorting to desperate measures.\n\nBy revisiting these stories, we see echoes of our present. Fear of contagion, misinformation spreading faster than facts, and the uneven impact across classes—it’s all there, hidden in manuscripts and archaeological records.",
