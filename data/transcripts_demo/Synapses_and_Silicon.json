  "text": "Brains and computers both process information, but their methods differ. Neurons fire with chemical signals and variability; transistors flip with electric precision. Comparing them isn’t about finding superiority but inspiration. Neural nets borrow the idea of layers from biology, yet scale them far beyond evolution’s path."
