  "text": "Polls are often misinterpreted as crystal balls, but they are closer to photographs: snapshots with blur. A poll with a margin of error of ±3% is not predicting the future, but estimating public opinion within a range. Treating it as prophecy sets you up for disappointment.\n\nChallenges include sampling bias, where the people who answer are not representative; nonresponse bias, where certain groups systematically decline; and weighting, which requires careful statistical adjustments. Errors compound quickly if these issues are ignored.\n\nThe lesson is humility. Polls can be useful guides, but they are not destiny. Just as a weather forecast tells you it might rain but can’t guarantee it, polls should be read as probabilistic, not deterministic."
