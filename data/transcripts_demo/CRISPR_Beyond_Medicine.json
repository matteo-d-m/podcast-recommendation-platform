  "text": "CRISPR is famous for gene therapy, but its reach extends further. Scientists are using it to engineer crops resistant to drought, create mosquitoes that can’t carry malaria, and even explore resurrecting extinct species.\n\nThe technology acts like molecular scissors guided by GPS coordinates of DNA. The promise is enormous—but so are the risks. Releasing edited organisms into ecosystems could trigger cascading effects.\n\nAs with many breakthroughs, CRISPR is both a tool and a test. It challenges us to balance innovation with restraint, pushing science forward while ensuring we don’t rewrite life recklessly."
