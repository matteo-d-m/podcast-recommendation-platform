  "text": "Fractions feel abstract in school, but they show up every time you slice a pizza. Sharing one pie among four people is dividing into fourths; combining two slices is adding fractions with like denominators.\n\nWhere confusion arises is mixing unlike denominators. One friend eats a third of a cake, another eats a quarter. To compare, you reslice into twelfths. This concrete imagery—reslicing food—helps the math click.\n\nMath teachers who anchor fractions in such everyday contexts reduce fear. Suddenly, it’s not symbols on paper but food at the table. That small shift transforms engagement."
