  "text": "Welcome back to Byte Size AI. Today we are going to dive into vision transformers, a model that has reshaped computer vision. Imagine splitting an image into patches, almost like dividing a comic book page into its individual panels. Each patch is treated like a token in language models, and the transformer learns how these tokens relate to one another. Instead of reading words, it reads visual fragments, connecting them to capture context.\n\nThe strength of this approach is that it removes the rigid grid structure of convolutional neural networks. CNNs act like looking through a fixed magnifying glass, scanning piece by piece. Vision transformers, by contrast, can learn long-range dependencies — like noticing that a ball in the top-left corner and a player in the bottom-right are part of the same story. This global awareness is why ViTs outperform CNNs on large datasets.\n\nWe’ll walk through examples from self-driving cars, where transformers help link a pedestrian’s motion to a traffic light, and medical imaging, where they connect subtle patterns across an entire scan. By the end, you’ll see why the same architecture that changed natural language processing is now rewriting the playbook for vision."
