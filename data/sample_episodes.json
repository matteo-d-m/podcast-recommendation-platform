  "transcript": "Welcome back to Byte Size AI. Today we are going to dive into vision transformers, a model that has reshaped computer vision. Imagine splitting an image into patches, almost like dividing a comic book page into its individual panels. Each patch is treated like a token in language models, and the transformer learns how these tokens relate to one another. Instead of reading words, it reads visual fragments, connecting them to capture context.\n\nThe strength of this approach is that it removes the rigid grid structure of convolutional neural networks. CNNs act like looking through a fixed magnifying glass, scanning piece by piece. Vision transformers, by contrast, can learn long-range dependencies — like noticing that a ball in the top-left corner and a player in the bottom-right are part of the same story. This global awareness is why ViTs outperform CNNs on large datasets.\n\nWe’ll walk through examples from self-driving cars, where transformers help link a pedestrian’s motion to a traffic light, and medical imaging, where they connect subtle patterns across an entire scan. By the end, you’ll see why the same architecture that changed natural language processing is now rewriting the playbook for vision."

  "transcript": "Shipping lanes might look like invisible highways across the ocean, but they are as critical to the global economy as railroads once were to industrialization. Consider the Suez Canal incident in 2021: one ship blocked billions of dollars of trade daily. That wasn’t just about delayed deliveries—it cascaded into shortages, inflated prices, and strained supply chains.\n\nThese maritime arteries are chosen not only for geography but also for safety, fuel efficiency, and international treaties. A detour around Africa adds weeks and millions in costs. Insurance companies factor in piracy risks, and governments maintain naval patrols to secure their trade lifelines.\n\nSo when you buy a smartphone assembled in Asia, or coffee beans shipped from South America, you are indirectly depending on these lanes. They are a hidden infrastructure of globalization, one that links distant economies as tightly as fiber optic cables link data across the world."

  "transcript": "In today’s episode we confront a big question in modern systems programming: is Rust really the future? The language promises memory safety without garbage collection, an enticing proposition for developers who know the pain of segmentation faults or dangling pointers.\n\nRust’s borrow checker can feel strict, like a librarian insisting that every borrowed book must be returned before you can borrow another. But that strictness eliminates a whole category of bugs that plague C and C++ programs. The result is code that is both safe and blazing fast.\n\nWe’ll explore real-world examples: Rust powering parts of the Linux kernel, game engines written in Rust for performance-critical loops, and startups adopting it for blockchain nodes. Of course, the language isn’t perfect—it has a steep learning curve, and compile times are notorious. But when you weigh the safety guarantees against these drawbacks, you begin to see why the industry says: it’s Rust, or bust."

  "transcript": "Entropy sounds abstract, but you encounter it every day when cooking. Why does an ice cube melt in a warm drink? Why does cream mix into coffee instead of unmixing? These everyday processes illustrate the second law of thermodynamics: systems naturally evolve toward states with more possible arrangements.\n\nTake the melting ice. There are vastly more ways for water molecules to arrange as liquid than as solid, so the system tends to melt. It’s not that ice prefers disorder—it’s just that disorder has higher probability. Similarly, stirring cream into coffee creates millions of microscopic patterns. The chance of them spontaneously reverting to a pristine separation is astronomically low.\n\nEntropy is thus not about chaos in the colloquial sense, but about probability and arrangements. The next time you cook pasta, remember: the diffusion of salt into the water is entropy at work."

The truth is that functional products can still fail if users feel no connection.\n\nImagine two apps that both let you schedule meetings. One is clunky, the other greets you with a charming microinteraction when you confirm a time. Both solve the same problem, but only one earns loyalty. That’s the MLP difference.\n\nDesigners should therefore ask: what is the smallest feature set that still creates a memorable first impression? The MLP doesn’t ignore speed to market—it just ensures the early product also builds emotional resonance. A lovable product turns users into advocates, not just adopters."

  "transcript": "Principal Component Analysis is often taught with linear algebra formulas, but it helps to picture it geometrically. Imagine your dataset as a cloud of points. The goal is to rotate the axes so that they align with the directions of maximum variance. These directions are the principal components.\n\nThe first component captures the longest stretch of the cloud; the second captures the next longest, orthogonal to the first. By projecting data onto these axes, we reduce dimensions while preserving most of the structure.\n\nThis geometric intuition shows why PCA is used in fields from finance to genetics. In stock markets, it identifies underlying factors that move prices together. In biology, it condenses gene expression data. Thinking of PCA as simply rotating your perspective helps ground the math in a picture you can visualize."

By annotating function inputs and outputs, you create living documentation for your team.\n\nLinters and IDEs can then catch mismatches before runtime. This saves debugging time and improves code readability. When you revisit code six months later, type hints remind you what each function expects.\n\nThe key is balance. Overly rigid typing can slow down rapid prototyping. But in production systems, the clarity and safety provided by type hints outweigh the cost. Ultimately, they’re not just for the computer—they’re for future you and your teammates."

A poll with a margin of error of ±3% is not predicting the future, but estimating public opinion within a range. Treating it as prophecy sets you up for disappointment.\n\nChallenges include sampling bias, where the people who answer are not representative; nonresponse bias, where certain groups systematically decline; and weighting, which requires careful statistical adjustments. Errors compound quickly if these issues are ignored.\n\nThe lesson is humility. Polls can be useful guides, but they are not destiny. Just as a weather forecast tells you it might rain but can’t guarantee it, polls should be read as probabilistic, not deterministic."

  "transcript": "Developers rely on logs to understand their systems, but logs can lie. Missing context, outdated messages, or inconsistent log levels create illusions of smooth operation while users face errors.\n\nThis happens because logging is often added reactively. We sprinkle statements during debugging but never revisit them systematically. Over time, logs become a patchwork that tells a partial story.\n\nThe fix is intentional logging: deciding what questions you want answered during incidents, and logging accordingly. Think of logs as a narrative you write for your future self. Good logs don’t gaslight—they guide. They are the difference between chasing ghosts at 2am and resolving an outage in minutes."

  "transcript": "The word ‘serverless’ is misleading. Servers are still there, humming in data centers, but the abstraction is moved away from the developer. You no longer patch, scale, or babysit machines—you just write functions that respond to events.\n\nThis shift matters because it democratizes scale. A small startup can suddenly run workloads that auto-scale to millions of requests, paying only for compute time. But there are trade-offs: cold starts can delay responses, and debugging distributed ephemeral functions is harder.\n\nThink of it as moving from owning a car to calling a ride-share. You don’t worry about oil changes, but you also lose some control. The art is knowing when serverless accelerates you, and when it shackles you."

Another is reframing productivity not as hours worked but as sustainable creativity. Companies that treat engineers like replaceable cogs often discover that talent quietly leaves.\n\nIn this episode, we talk with developers who’ve taken sabbaticals, companies experimenting with four-day weeks, and managers learning that protecting energy is protecting output."

For many solar panors, they want to automate a ton of things and  There's two questions that you probably have when it comes to automation.  What do I start with and how do I do it?  In today's episode where I chat with well, we  dive into so much stuff but really around automation will have this  incredible formula 15115 and he's going to talk all about it. It lays out  such a simple way for you to figure out what you're gonna automate and then we  talk about how to do it and we talk about a lot of stuff with AI. He gives his  favorite AI tools that people pay him a lot of money to help them with. We talk  about ADHD and building a business with ADHD, he has such a good in the  lighting round. One of my questions is what his creativity means to you and his  answer was one of my favorite on the podcast yet. So make sure you stay tuned  for that. If you haven't already, make sure you subscribe to the podcast. I  appreciate it so much. But I love this conversation with Will. It was really,  really good. I don't typically interview a lot of men on the podcast, but his  management team sent me over topics to discuss and I was reading it and was like I  need to have this conversation and I am so glad that I did. So without further  ado, let's chat with Will Christensen. Welcome to High Five Table Talks. The  podcast to help you the current or aspiring solar pannour navigate the messy  middle so you can make both an income and an impact. Hi, I'm Rishan and I love  of creating safe spaces for women to be courageous  in their dreams.  I'm very excited to dive into this conversation  with Will Christensen.  So we'll thank you for joining the podcast.  Yeah, happy to be here.  So I am in Syracuse, Utah, which is north of Salt Lake City.  I was from Colin in from, from my basement  because I went remote in 2018 before it was cool.  And then the whole rest of the world  decided to join me in 2020.  I have no idea why that was.  Yeah, so I serve many different segments.  I've got a lot of experience in automation  and integration.  That's kind of where my career started  and then it shifted more towards delegation,  which is where I'm focused now.  And I clone solo pinures.  So solo pinures who are looking to make their first hire,  I made so many mistakes on my first hires.  So many mistakes.  And so we've got a guaranteed process  that we help solar pinures go through  where they can't mess it up.  Like it's impossible to mess it up  because we've got so many good systems in place  to coach them and support them and help them actually scale.  There's kind of two parts of the conversation I wanna have.  I'm excited to dive into the 15115.  Yep.  But I also wanna dive into you as an entrepreneur  and how you run your business and kind of the,  I love to dive into the messy middle parts of it.  And it seems like you have done that yourself.  You know, you said you made a lot of mistakes.  And you really help a lot of other entrepreneurs  through that.  So I want to kind of hit both sides of that.  So yeah, absolutely.  I won't leave the audience hanging on too long.  Can you share with us what is the 15115 method?  Great question.  So basically I had people coming to me  and the most common question they would ask  is what should I be automating?  It's interesting because it seems like a simple question.  Like I should just be able to tell you,  here's the five workflows you absolutely should be automating.  And I can tell you some common workflows,  but what I discovered was that everybody was  a little bit different.  And so what they needed was actually a way  to discover for themselves what should be automated.  And I learned later, it's actually what should be automated,  delegated and or eliminated.  So like where do we go through that process?  And so the short version is 15115 is what you should write on a sticky note.  So pause the podcast, go find a sticky note, or open up your phone and open a new note on your phone.  And that new note of the top is going to say 15-1-1-1-1.  What that stands for is 15 minutes a day, an hour a week, or an hour a month.  So think how often do tasks happen?  They happen daily, weekly or monthly.  If it goes over 50 minutes a day,  over an hour a week,  over an hour a month,  you should probably consider  automating, delegating or eliminating that task.  If it's lower than that, don't get sucked down that rabbit hole.  I have spent eight to 10 hours trying to automate  like a 10 minute task.  And I got to the end of it, I automated it,  but I was like, oh man, that's gonna take five years  to become ROI positive for the time that I saved  by automating this thing.  So sometimes it's okay to dive into that way  because you know you're learning something  that's gonna help your clients  and I've done that before on purpose,  but do it intentionally.  So when you write down each one of those things,  the last five is do it five times manually.  So on your list, let's say that you opened up a new note  in on your iPhone or on your Android phone,  and you type in voice type, I love voice typing.  I've voice type in, this is the task  that I've got happening and it's weekly.  Then ignore that for a while until it comes up again.  Oh, it came up.  So put a tally mark.  So you would put a tally mark,  one, two, three, four, five tally marks next to that item.  And then once you've done it five times,  you know enough about the if-then's  inside that process that you can actually write a standard operating procedure for it  and automate it and or automate it depending on what's out there. You know enough about it to  actually automate. That's how you decide what you should automate. Yeah. And it's so great because  you know, one of the reasons why, you know, when when you're assistant whoever you use to  touch base with other podcasts to see if we can connect is around ADHD and I was listening to  Oh man.  Some content of yours earlier, how you're allergic to the copying, pasting texts, you  automated something to help you pick up garbage when you were a kid.  And so it sounds like there's a lot of curiosity just naturally built in to like how can  I eliminate the things that make me want to stab my eyes out?  Like a lot of my community, my audience really resonates with that.  a great, great place to start. And I think that your formula allows people to chunk things  out. And like, you know, okay, I did this five times. I can I take an hour this week to  automate it so I can get that ROI back like you said.  It removes the to be or not to be question. So you don't, you're not standing there as  hamlet holding that skull and saying, should we automate? Yeah, we should not. We automate.  I found myself asking that question to myself over and over and over again.  And then I would go do the thing and I would automate it and I was like, well crap, that was a total  waste of time. I should not have automated that because now the client is coming in and they're  saying maybe instead of often. And if then statement was off of the maybe, it's like, it just  So many things that I just did not understand.  And so that was the whole purpose was how can I create a way for me to not get trapped in the should I automate cycle?  And then out of fear, because I've got to automate something, you go down a rabbit hole and you get to the end of it.  And so another question people were often asking me, how can I get my team to adopt automation  or AI?  How can I at the time it wasn't AI?  Because AI wasn't a thing.  But how can I get my team to adopt this?  I say, the first thing you've got to do is stop them from going down the automation  rabbit hole that doesn't actually work.  Because there's no faster way than to burn the automation or AI bridge for your employee  then to send them down the rabbit hole,  they spent four hours trying to automate whatever it was  and they get zero return.  Mm-hmm.  Have that happen two or three times  and you're never doing it again.  Yeah.  And so giving your teammates a framework  so that that gets taken care of, that's gold.  And so segue being AI,  I mean, what are some things that like you use yourself  or provide your customers with AI that really helps with efficiency.  Beautiful question.  So the one I'm talking about a lot right now is called perplexity.  If you use perplexity yet?  No.  Oh my gosh.  This has replaced the big G for me.  I no longer use Google.  Really?  Really.  Like I actually, I googled something the other day  and I was so frustrated with the results page, I was like, that's it.  And I went and installed a Chrome extension that made it so that perplexity is now my omnibox search bar.  Wow.  So like if I hit control T and open a new tab and type, perplexity is what gets the query.  Now, there's a couple of situations where I found this to be annoying.  When I do searches, I do searches for one of two reasons.  I'm looking for information, right?  I'm trying to make some sort of decision,  or I just want the dang website.  Like I can't remember the exact URL,  so I want it to pop up at the top.  Proplexity kind of stinks at that.  Like it does not do a very good job of finding you  that top search result kind of situation.  I've had to go back to Google for some of those situations.  And I'm wondering if there's something like...  some sort of keyboard shortcut or something that I can tell it.  but I just want you to find the correct URL associated  with this thing.  And you could type it in like whatever my career was,  URL, and I'm sure it would do it just fine.  What I've discovered though is you can ask it questions like,  who in the lifetime of Marvel Comics  has been worthy of picking up Thor's hammer?  Oh.  You go type that in there, and here's the crazy part.  it will go in and it will go through a search results page.  And it will basically using some advanced logic,  like it says, okay, the user's gonna give a query  and you're gonna respond.  And before you ask, think about the query  and see if there's a way that you can rephrase it  in a way that more people might have searched for it.  And so it's doing the searching for you better than you would  because most of the time, people aren't fantastic Googlers,  my wife's like, I don't know how you find crap online,  but you seem to be able to find stuff.  I can't find.  And the reason I can find stuff is because I spend the time  to like modify the words so that they are more common.  And I watch the suggestions.  So I get more stuff.  I don't have to do that anymore.  I just type it into perplexity.  Proplexity says, oh, cool.  And it goes through.  It reads the seven or eight different pages  that were relevant to what I was describing.  And then it summarizes the answer.  So instead of me having to go look through  every single page and look at all of what's there,  it's just there.  Chachi B.D. 4 has recently announced  and they've got a search function  that's built into Chachi B.D. 4.  They had one a while ago,  they were getting lots of complaints for copyright,  they got rid of it, they brought it back.  It's okay.  It is not as good.  I have found as perplexity.  Proplexity is good enough that I've been able to be like,  I want to buy a new podcasting mic.  Find me the top podcasting mics out there  and compare and contrast them in a table.  And the table is dang accurate.  Wow.  That's really cool.  And I hadn't come on specifically around AI,  not that long ago.  And one of the things as we were discussing,  it was like one of the tips is just,  instead of going to Google,  to Chet GPT or go to some sort of AI because when Google first came out, we didn't know how to prompt it.  It was like, find me food and you're like, okay, well, where are you? Do you have a dietary  restriction? How much money do you want to spend? Do you have kids? Like, there's all these factors  and you have to prompt Google with those things. And now we're just learning how to prompt  AI and it sounds like perplexity does a really good job of learning more about what type of  results that you specifically want on top of your query.  Yep. Yep.  So very cool.  So before we hit record, we were kind of talking about some of the content  that you do put out and I was thinking about it when I was listening to one of  your some of your earlier content around like you put out a ton of free content.  And I know that a lot of solo Pinour struggle with,  am I giving away too much stuff?  Am I giving away too much for free  that people are never going to buy from me?  So how would you answer that question  for those who struggle with that?  So what I would say is as a solo Pinour,  you don't have a lot of advantages in this war  that is business, right?  Like in this game of like competition,  cutthroat, you know, I'm gonna eat your lunch  because I want that business, you know,  we don't have a lot of things going for us  in terms of like, man, we're so good at this.  The two things we do have is our agility.  We're able to move really fast.  Where these large organizations  that do the same things we do are kinda slow.  Because it's such a large organization.  There's a lot of bureaucracy that I cut through.  all of that kind of stuff this there.  The second advantage we have is teaching.  When we share our knowledge,  because those big corporations, they will not share.  That's like, that's our bread and butter.  We're gonna teach you, you know,  become a client and then we'll teach you how to do  all of this stuff.  My experience is I can over-educate my audience  to the point where they realize just how complicated  the thing I've become an expert in is.  And so 15115,  You don't pay anything to get that from me today.  And the reason I shared it is because I know,  once you get a list of like 20 different things  that you're trying to automate  that you've done five times manually,  they're gonna be like,  crap, I might need some help, right?  And that's on purpose  because you have a sticky note on your desk  that says 15-115.  That's way better than a business card  that I just sat down in front of you.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, what better way for you to remember?  Oh yeah, Will helps with this kind of stuff.  Or he might know somebody that helps with this kind of stuff  and can kind of dig into all of those different pieces.  Mm-hmm.

New episodes released the second and fourth Tuesday  of every month.  And remember, the star 716, where education meets conversation.  Yeah, I heard someone say recently that in the age  in which we are with the internet, people  are a lot less willing to pay for education.  They're willing to pay more for application.  And so I mean, you can Google,  practice it, what proximity?  Proplexity.  Perplexity.  You go perplexity.  Anything.  And you're going to get a ton of free stuff back.  But now how do I go and apply it to my business with my ADHD  in the specific type of offering that I have?  Yep.  Here's, so one of the things that I found that's super interesting,  and I'll be curious to see who fine tunes this enough  to the point where I'm willing to pay for it. But I have had moments where I'm like, okay,  pretend your Alex or Mosey, Chadgy BT and rewrite this for me. Right? Re rewrite this email that  I'm trying to send. You can go 10 steps farther, turn on the voice mode, which by the way, the voice  mode on Chadgy BT four has gotten really good. Like wicked good. You can actually interrupt it.  So you can be like, hey, oh yeah, you don't have to wait for it.  Like it is amazing what it will do and how easy it is.  So like I have on my phone, I've got it right here in front of me.  So basically I can just open it up and say, hey,  chat GPT, you're about to be on a podcast.  What would you want to tell people about yourself?  Like what can you do?  Let's see if this works.  Absolutely.  That works.  If I were to introduce myself on a podcast, I'd say,  hey there, I'm chat GPT, a conversational AI developed by OpenAI.  I'm here to chat, help out, and share knowledge on a wide range of topics,  from answering questions to offering advice,  or even just having a friendly chat.  I aim to make conversations engaging and engaging.  So I'm actually going to interrupt you there real quick.  What I'd love for you to do is look up Will Christensen.  He's the guy who founded Data Automation.  and look up 15115. What is that?  a focus work, one minute of break, and five minutes of review.  You're totally hallucinating there.  You may want to look into that a little more.  So as you can see, it's going to be off sometimes, not exactly what's there, but it did  a great job of guessing and it sounded really good.  If I didn't actually know what it was, I would have totally believed that.  Well, so that's the downside of AI, right?  You have to be careful with some of those different pieces.  I was really, like I knew I was stretching its boundaries.  Yeah.  That's probably the key thing I would say for the listeners.  If you haven't had multiple conversations  and have a conversation with something about something  that you're super knowledgeable,  like you just finished a book,  have a conversation with about that book  and start to ask it more specific  and more specific and more specific questions,  you'll figure out, oh, there's a level of specificity  out there where if I know that this is probably only  found on two blog posts in the entire world.  The AI probably doesn't have enough data to train on that  to actually give you a reliable answer.  And so I knew when I asked it,  tell them, did it get who I am?  Like give a bio for Will Christensen?  It's got that all over the place.  And I'm on hundreds of different podcast episodes  so I know that information's out there for it to train on.  But 15115, that's probably in maybe 10 or 15 different episodes.  And so it had enough to know that it was a framework, but it didn't have enough to give you the exact details of that framework.  And so my challenge for the audience would be go start having conversations with it daily and do so in a way where you begin to understand its boundaries and limits.  Yeah.  So that's that's the real challenge of AI is knowing like my gut said,  Mmm. Should you ask it the 15.15 question? And I was like, it'll be hilarious if it hallucinates.  Yeah. I knew that that's where it was at, where it could go. And that's because I have  pushed those boundaries on a regular basis to see where what is it actually capable of getting  right? Yeah. So with, I mean, it's incredible how much AI and deep learning and all of these  technologies have it feels it felt like they were growing exponentially now they're  growing at the speed of light and I'm sure that every generation says that but as solo  pernours who our time is such a valuable currency and we're trying to figure out where to put our  time. How do you manage new technologies new things that are coming out on of you know what feels  I was like, because I know every person listening to this is going to go and like Google  themselves through chat, GPT or you know, like they're going to see, you know, do that  thing, the prompt that we just did.  So how do you manage that?  So my, so perplexity is an amazing tool for this.  The reason I would use perplexity and I would pay for it is because the paid version will  let you do more searches.  You can try it out for free.  It's got, it's got its own free version.  The thing that's amazing about the platform is when I have a question about which piece  of software should I use for X, Y, and Z, it reads that first page.  So instead of me having to get overwhelmed by all of those different sales pages, it reads  them for me, gives me a semi-informed decision so that I can then whittle down and go down  to the information that I really wanted.  Another thing that I would honestly recommend is automationhunter.com.  So automationhunter.com is a website that I publish to.  It's actually a YouTube channel as well.  And I am constantly reviewing apps.  So I'm going in and I'm finding what's out there for solo pedoers that that's going to  make a difference.  And so, you know, you're welcome to submit reviews to me or say, I call it creating a bounty.  You're welcome to create a bounty with me and basically say, well, I need to find an app  that does X, Y, or Z.  I will go find or sometimes it's as simple as like you go so so if you're an entrepreneur and you're  you know considering this idea of a new app and you're like switching to a new CRM is such a pain  in the butt like I don't I do not know which one I should switch to. That's a perfect example of a  bounty email me will at equityhammer.com. We'll jump on a 15 minute episode of Automation Hunter  and I will ask you questions about that bounty and then recommend a CRM.  So like there are lots of resources like that out there that are constantly trying to help  with that overwhelm. But I would say the first step is just buckle up because it's going to be  a ride and don't be afraid to try new things, but also don't spend too much time trying all the  the new things are you'll never actually build a business.  Yeah. Yeah. That's a great point.  I have a couple episodes around CRMs.  And so that's a great place to start because I think CRMs  should be salespeople and entrepreneurs'  bibles. They should be touching.  But it can be like, I don't even know where to start with the CRM.  And so I always tell people to start with a Excel spreadsheet  because it's easily accessible before you figure out  what you do want, what you are going to use.  So I would recommend rather than Excel.  Excel is what everybody, they all know like tables,  whatever, Google sheets, that kind of thing.  I actually tell people to go to Airtable,  Coda, Notion, or ClickUp.  One of those three, use the table functionality,  because they all have free versions.  All three of those platforms I just mentioned,  all have free versions.  The key is that they can do relational databases.  So you can have a contacts tab and a companies tab and you can assign contacts to one company.  Where a spreadsheet falls down first as a CRM is when you're trying to assign two contacts to the  same company because then you're putting in a carbon separated list and if you try to do a  mail merge on that, I try. Like you run into all sorts of problems when you try to begin to force  a one-dimensional piece of data.  That's what a spreadsheet is.  It's one dimension into a two-dimensional,  meaning I want to associate two records  with one record in another table, relational database.  So all of those platforms I just mentioned,  air table, click-up, notion, and,  Okoda was the other one that I mentioned.  All of those have free templates for CRMs  that you can go get right now.  And it's just as flexible as a spreadsheet. Delete, merge, move whatever, going there before  the spreadsheet will actually save you some time and energy because it's going to have all the  fields on there already that you got to fill out and delete any that don't make sense  because it's very similar to a spreadsheet. Right. So that's where I would go first. And I agree,  If you're not currently writing down who you're talking to, holy crap, go write down  the stuff we were talking to.  I've been shocked with, like I just tried a new one called Adio, ATTIO.  It's an automatic spreadsheet, so it looks at your email history and your calendar and  then just updates itself.  I have not dug into it in grand detail, a good friend of mine who runs a podcast, excuse  not a podcast. She runs a monthly newsletter called Optimize Monthly.  So it's optimized monthly.com. She and I are kind of partnering up to kind of  build out a directory of sorts. She's using Addie right now. And she's,  she's on it. She's on the paid version and she's been on for about a month.  It's got a lot of cool sequences. She's not sure if she's going to continue  paying for it. But it was pretty cool to see it fill itself out. Like I,  I got it and I was like, oh cool, they've got some sample data.  Wait a second.  I've emailed like all those, oh my gosh,  this is, there's 1900 contacts in here  and I didn't put any of them in here.  Oh, and it started like categorizing them in like,  you know, which industry they were in  and how large the companies were.  And I was like, oh my, so anyway, lots out there  to test and play with.  Like working in, I had a role where I was specifically just in sales and now running a business and working with entrepreneurs like a lot of entrepreneurs with ADHD.  That data entry is like soul crushing.  And if you can a AI tool.  Soul crushing is the right word for that.  Because I think entrepreneurs are dynamic.  They're engaging.  They love talking.  They love creating.  They love connecting.  They copy and pasting.  Like you said, we're allergic to it.  And so painful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I think AI's biggest compliment  is going to be doing this stuff that crushes your soul,  that is painful to you.  So honestly, AI was, so I can remember being in high school.  This guy gets up on the stage and he was like, so they want me to come out here and motivate  you.  They had like motivational speakers, they would hire to come speak to high school students  to get them revved up about college and you know, all of the other, like go, go, become  someone, right?  The guy goes, you know the coolest thing about working hard and like actually being successful  And we're all like, yeah, what?  And he was like, I don't have to know how to spell.  And I was like, what the fetches even mean?  Like that's like the opposite of what my English user  taught me last hour.  He said, I have an assistant who does all of that for me.  She manages my entire everything when it comes to that.  And at that moment, I was like,  that's gonna be me one day because I can't spell worth beans.  Like we are going to figure out  how to do that. And that has kind of been my mission in life is to figure out how to connect  those dots. On the note of an assistant said every entrepreneur ever, I wish I just had someone  who would sit on all my calls and write down all the to do's. And then I take care of  them, like like I'll do them, but I just need somebody to write them all down because this  whole note taking thing on the call like so frustrating for 12 bucks a month plus maybe 20  bucks a month. So like 33 bucks a month. So you know what? I bet I could do it in under  31. So for for a dollar a day, I have fathom note taker that sits on every single one of  my phone calls and it captures all of the to do's pushes those to do's to zap your that  get pushed to click up and all of my todo's are written down with a little link back to  the timestamp of where the AI thinks that the task came from.  For $1 a day, I have a freaking, and it's better than full time guys.  I could get on 80 hours of meeting every week and guess what, it doesn't care.  It just jumps on and continues doing that.  AI opened the door for those of us with ADHD in a way that is just mind numbing.  I felt so I'm very religious and I said some very thankful prayers to Heavenly Father when  AI became a thing because I was like, I feel like this was made for my brain.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I have just been diagnosed with ADHD this year and so the grace of like this is how my brain  works has been life changing. And so then to find tools like that. So I could talk forever with you.  Actually, I would like, run of applause because I was so tempted to come on like as you were talking  when I was listening to other content. If you're so I was like, I want to dig, have you like,  break apart by business and but the audience doesn't want to listen to you bring me apart by business.  Well, we should definitely do that on another call. Anyone who is currently out there  and this is an offer that's open to your whole audience as well.  Anyone who is currently in the mode of trying to figure out  how to grow that solar printer business.  And they're at a point where they're charging more  than $150 an hour for their time.  That's my only requirement.  Jump on a phone call with me for 15 minutes  and I'll bet you a $50 Amazon gift card.  I will change your life before the end of that call  in terms of automation and integration  and like will help you find a new app.  will help you find a new piece of what's there  and pick apart one of those challenges.  And that's on the table and a bet I'm willing to make.  So if you get me and I'm like,  yeah, I totally lost that.  I can't do the $50 gift card thing,  but I'll happily help you.  I'll be surprised.  I have yet to experience,  I'm happy to pay out 100, 200, 300 bucks a month  to keep that off for alive.  So I will happily pay you,  but I'll be shocked if I can't find something  to share with you that doesn't shift your world for you  in automation or AI.  That's awesome.  So I'm gonna challenge you  because we're running up on time  to see if we can get the lightning round questions  and the fastest time yet on the past.  All right.  I'm ready for the lightning round.  What is a must read book?  Oh my gosh.  Leadership in self-deception.  This book changed my life in terms of how I work with other people.  So that book, get a grip on your business  which is like Gina Wickman traction.  It's the, the fable, the entrepreneurial fable  that talks about that.  That book is amazing.  And then four disciplines of execution.  Awesome. What does creativity mean to you?  Creativity means looking at a problem  through a different lens than the one you normally wear.  So being willing to say, okay, today I'm wearing my,  I'm afraid of being abandoned lens.  And now I'm not, okay, how does that problem look?  So, like, being willing to shift the lenses through which you look at the world to try to solve a problem, that's what creativity is to me.  That's awesome. What is the best piece of advice you've ever received?  Oh, my gosh.  Probably always be honest.  Like, like honesty is the best policy, right? Like that it sounds super cliche, but I have found that in moments when it feels like it might be better to  obvious gate or scrape something under the rug, that has often come back to bite me.  And so I would say transparency is probably your most effective tool in client relationships.  Yeah. I agree with that. What is something that's on your bucket list?  I would love to, two things all throughout there. One, I served a two-year mission for the  Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints in Brazil. I would love to take my wife and family  back to Brazil. To meet some of the people that I met there, I was 19 when I was there 20 years ago.  It's blowing my brain out that I can't believe it's been 20 years. Yeah, that's where  not going there. I'm going to go midlife crisis on you. So the other thing that I would love to  do is I would love to go to Europe. Specifically Scotland, Ireland. I've got some ancestors from  that side of the world.  And I'm hugely and well as fan.  And just I really think that there's some cool stuff.  I've worn a kit to church multiple times.  Yeah.  So I want to go back there with my wife.  So that'd be cool.  That's awesome.  My, not, this is lightning round is not about me,  but my goal is to spend my 40th birthday in Ireland  with my friends and family.  So we're on the countdown for about two and a half years to tell that.  So I think I might join you on that on that.  Can I be added to the group of friends that come to you?  Because I think we're, I'm actually very close to that.  I'm, I turn 39 in April.  So I got like a year and a half.  So I got to, I got to figure out how to make that happen.  That's something that could go.  Well, Nightchu, uh, coin was the ancestors who came over from Ireland.

  "transcript": " Hey folks, happy Sunday. We're here to annoy you on another Sunday night.  At least now and a half, not two hours.  What's up folks? Everybody had a great weekend, great week since we saw everybody on Tuesday for our last watch,  long which was H2O. And tonight we...  Brett, I completely forgot about this because I was busy. I had my band played yesterday,  so I was busy with that all day, and then I was on the handle after party, and that's how I had to  that Halloween movie, quite sure,  having a little bit to drink too much to drink last night?  Yeah.  So I didn't realize yesterday was the 40th anniversary  of the release of the returning to the living dead.  So we thought, well, so we don't live this too.  Or talk about some zombie movies tonight.  Our favorite zombie movies,  everybody in the chat's favorite zombie movies,  and do a review of Return of the Living Dead.  Yeah, we bumped Pee Wee's Big Adventure again.  It will do it one of these weekends.  Maybe it will do a member stream,  But we're gonna do return to Living Dead,  watch along on Tuesday to celebrate 40 years of  at Classic, which is considered to be  a lot of people's favorite zombie film.  And, Brady's just getting set up.  He didn't have his headphones.  While he's getting set up, I'm gonna,  my phone fell on the floor.  So hold on one second.  Okay, I'm here.  I'm here.  Hi everybody, hello.  All right.  Happy Sunday, bud.  Happy Sunday.  get a clean sheet from my book because I always write things down.  Now you're looking to look two different flights and steps.  So yeah, so tonight I was told that zombie movies that once be like,  one said, may or may not even seen, people can suggest people can let us know in the chat  which their favorite zombie films are. We'll be reviewing Turn the Living Dead.  Because like I said, you mentioned that it was turned 40, I say, which I didn't even realize.  So we bought Peemies Big Adventure maybe to next week or a members chat.  members are only stream and we'll do a review of that and then we're doing our top five.  We changed it to Pee me or was it how I hate to say I thought how we was a  reaction one of voting even though I don't know. I don't know.  Oh that's right resurrection did win that poll.  It's like the first one.  Pee we probably did.  But we're gonna make sure.  Even like a fur we bought it to Pee we but I thought if we're going off of the poll from last  they're from Tuesday.  Yeah it's got the poll that one was resurrection yeah because everybody likes to make fun of it.  So yeah, I did bump that maybe we could do another night.  If you're free, we can do two this week.  I don't give a shit.  I don't have much going on this week.  So you get me a schedule is and we can just make it up.  And I got to talk like practices, but if maybe one of them  we can do a little bit later and evening maybe.  Yeah, we heard a little bit later.  So you're home in time.  And our top five because of Fred.  Mike and I finally watched together the other night.  So you're about to do our top five body horror movies  because movie was pretty fucked up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I know you would have gotten a kick out of it, though.  So yeah, I remember you tell me about it.  Other people are talking about it.  So I figured I'd watch it.  Mike, Mike, you know, I didn't think that would be his movie,  though.  No way.  No.  But it was fun to watch.  It was interesting to say the least.  I like her a lot, though.  She's been on a lot of things I've watched over the last few  years.  So yeah, she was good.  But the other one was, um, hey, John.  And the actor, the guy was, um, just that, what's the name?  His brother.  Yeah, James Frankl's brother.  Hey, you do know those two have been married for a number of years.  She's got a few years on him.  They're really married.  I figured you'd probably knew that right now.  No, no.  I really did not know that.  So the two, the girl that was in him are married in real life.  Yeah.  I was free and day Frank or married.  Yeah.  Did not know that.  It was interesting.  Can me, it was, I mean, I, it's pretty interesting.  concept for somebody that even create that. It's pretty fucked up. Just say for  least, but yeah, you know, were you thinking, okay, or did you want to talk about  the movie now or you talk about it later? I guess it doesn't matter whatever you want.  Yeah, we're talking about when we get into that. Yeah, we can, we can, we can chat.  We can go, uh, say hello to everybody in the chat. Let's see who's hanging out with us  on a Sunday night.  Brody was hanging out with us in here. He is.  Hey, yes, I was.  That's already.  David, yeah, what's up? Thanks, buddy. Make sure everybody hits that like button.  Thanks, David.  Definitely helps and if you're not subscribed,  don't forget to subscribe button.  Doesn't hurt. Just touch it.  It make it baby.  Look at bigger.  Is that a different shirt than the one I bought you?  They're at the same time.  One time.  One time.  It is the same one for Walmart.  Yeah.  I got to pick up a Walmart daily day.  Okay.  So then I'll, I'll make sure that I don't have to send you that then.  I was seven.  Just a bit one more too.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You had me pick that up in the hoodie.  Did I have you pick this up?  Just ask me.  I'll take it because I always have my multiples of these because they're cheap.  They're like eight, nine bucks.  I always buy multiples.  So, radio ball ones, I think I bought like three of them for four bucks.  Then they have a clearance.  Yeah, they're cheap.  Gory's in the house. What's up, Gory? JG's up. What's going on?  Hey, JG.  Is there's Jean? What's going on?  Jean?  Hello, Gendard.  King Matthew. What's up, Matthew? What's up?  How are you doing tonight?  Unfortunately, I'm only able to stand straight for a few minutes tonight.  So, I'm about to go out to eat with my girlfriend since it's our...  Oh, happy anniversary.  Happy anniversary.  Yeah, have a good dinner. That's awesome.  Keep the health going man. Keep it. Yeah. Also me and my girlfriend are getting married next month.  So most of the pre- Well, oh, did you show fiance I would assume that's that's good news.  Mamp congratulations congrats. Yes. Congrats. Very cool. And I've got this. Watch this.  I mean, realize how they were once like us human beings. Yeah, because so when we  didn't watch the long have landed the dead, you it's weird because usually you always  have sympathy for the characters that are being chased by the zombies and we  watched that. You had more sympathy for the zombies because they just like the  guy said he's like they're just trying to find a place you know yeah it's you  know they didn't choose to be that so World War Z I still didn't see World War Z  I just know the red movie what's that I just know of the Brad Pitt movie the  world worthy good for them. I think they're supposed to do another one I thought. I don't know what happened.  What is the one that was the TV show? Was that world worthy? Not the walking dead. There was  another one, another zombie one. I'll be on the chat. I can be a name of it. I'm curious which one you're  talking about. Yeah. Also, even though this doesn't count as a move of my favorite zombie TV show,  either between, there's a z-nation. Thank you. Z-nation. Oh, z-nation was that?  Yeah, I think we had something to do with that and the walking dead. Yeah. I tuned out of the  walking dead at like season five or six and I was like yeah.  I don't even think I watched more than two seasons. I just, uh,  as my kiss buddy what's up John? What is shaken?  What are your thoughts on death becomes her? My family walked out of it  last night during movie night because they're lame because that becomes her.  I haven't seen that one a long time.  I haven't seen it since the first came out. I should probably revisit it. Me too.  better opinion. That's um what uh is that Goldie horn? Is that Goldie  horn? Meryl Streep and first wolf? I think so. Yeah I've had seen probably since  came out either. It's been uh that's actually pretty cool that you mentioned them.  Maybe I'll have to revisit that. Oh there's our buddy Bill. Hello bin. And uh let's  give him his proper intro since he is here in the house. Fuck the other ever  gave. Fuck you. Send me this shit. It's a Bella Rose Salini. And this is a Robert  Zebekka spent. So really? Death becomes our ham. Yeah, check that out. Yeah, have to check  it out. It's been a long time. If you know it's a werewolf movie, but the character of Jack Goodman  and the all the werewolf victims in American werewolf and London is so very funny. Yeah,  Mark. Oh, yeah. Class. I landed this man. He knew what he was doing.  He was on fire back then. But he was just putting out tons of good movies and then that  whole thing with the twice. I'm really the smear on everything.  Unfortunately. But yeah, let's see. I have, let me get my, I had to get some slides together of  some of the ones that I do like. What is that? It's a wrong button. But I cons on streamyard and  and I don't like it at all.  It used to say exactly what it is,  but now they show icons.  And I'm like, well,  what if you can't figure out what the fuck am I going?  It's icons.  I don't know.  That becomes it.  It's a classic and the same thing,  it's reanimator and the substance.  Yeah, they may or may not be on my body horror.  Top five.  Why if he's not Google Slidesmith?  Oh, there it is.  You know what, man?  Do folks, I wife just got home.  So I knew she was coming from home just  I was about to get started. She was away helping the door to get settled in at school.  Where the hell was my pen? Shit. Start up that slide, Pat. Whatever you're ready.  Did come up. So yeah, I just threw a bunch of zombie movies out here. We can see where  which ones we like, which ones we didn't care for. And throw some more in the chat. I know these are not all of them.  These are just the most popular ones. And I know that I've, I think I've seen all of them.  I remember correctly when I went through this. Well, so of course this one is what I've mentioned  before is like my comfort movie that I put on all the time which I put on.  Once it Friday night, you're Friday night, I put it on.  I put this movie on the go to help me go to sleep.  Not because it's boring, but it's like comfort food, but not living dead.  The OG is just my favorite.  I just love not living dead.  We watched it so much as a kid just brings back memories of watching it every Halloween.  Because it was always on TV.  And yeah, so for me, my jibbit is still the OG.  I mean, I love all the other ones in the Romero franchise, but this is still always going to be my favorite.  Classic public domain.  Public domain. Yeah. And there's a lot of no, that was your mistake. They never put a copy right on it. So they screwed up.  One of the account favorite zombie movies has to be hammers plague of the zombies from 66 to make up zombies or creepiest. I've never seen that.  I haven't seen anything before. I live in dead when it comes to zombies.  Yeah, well, Colin, definitely, one of these days,  I think probably when they'll cool,  cool weather comes, I'm gonna revisit a lot of hammer films  and then maybe we'll start doing some type of hammer  watch along, and I'll be on.  Because I'd love to go back and revisit them.  There's so many of them I did see.  When I was younger than I'd seen,  I didn't see, but I just,  once the weather gets colder and, you know,  we'll put it up in the house, I can catch up on all that stuff.  White zombie, yeah?  True, the OG.  White zombie with Bella Lugosi.  White zombie.  by our name to uh...  for our zombies uh... first man  it did i'm sure it did right  long live  but naya return to the living dead yes yeah  when he uh... when he uh...  and i would make it because uh... world war z was disappointing yet you think so  i never saw world war z did you see it  yeah i didn't mind it uh... i i i i i got to go revisit  i i remember going into a slow expectations as probably why i like that a little  bit more  It's one of the ones I've not yet to see.  John says, for zombie movie, it would be the Omega Man,  for horror would be the original Poltergeist.  Well, the original Poltergeist is awesome,  but it's not me, what do you make a man?  Why am I, I don't know, they don't make a man.  Do you know that one?  Charlton Hestin, oh yeah.  Oh, that was like his era of like that,  and so I like green.  I know the movie, but I did not,  for life, he did not remember the name of it.  Holy shit.  Don't eat the so-called green, it's crazy.  I was going to put up here where I think was way back up here on the stream.  I thought I saw it on.  You just go up there.  Yeah, I can agree with Bill.  Oh, and Steve.  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  General Zad.  Zad died.  Yep.  Or head of what's the name of that?  It's the name of that organization.  And the, do you ever see the movie, both anger?  Both fingers great.  He's the head of mine head.  That's right.  I'm a company member of mine head.  Welcome to mine head.  Folkshees, Gates of Hell trilogy count.  Well, the Gates of Hell didn't that include zombie?  The original zombie?  I don't we consider anything zombie when a corpse comes back to life.  Pretty much.  That's why I agree with Bill.  Honestly, that cemetery can be considered as a zombie movie.  Yeah, no, I didn't put another creeps on my slides.  I forgot.  That's true because I'm always just considering it like a comedy.  somebody. You always forget that it's actually a zombie movie.  Absolutely.  Some people when I was looking online considered neither the  comedy movie you and I both like somewhat of a zombie movie.  I was like, I guess.  I can sort of see that. Yeah, that's another one.  We haven't watched that. I'm surprised we haven't been  done on a watch along yet.  I love the girls.  Cute girls too.  Oof.  Yeah.  Omega Man is based on Matheson's I am legend.  It was the second adaptation after the  of his surprise starring last night,  which Romero was likely influenced by Ford,  and I'd love to get it.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, the original I Am Legend,  and well, if in the remake is really good.  Don't of the Dead,  so Vietnam has always been Bill's number one,  and we're trying to live in Dead,  a close second.  I'm original, don't of the Dead,  I'm right there with him.  That is my favorite zombie movie of all time easily.  Just the idea of being stuck in the shot,  I'm happy. Right. Brilliant concept because okay, if you're going to be in a zombie apocalypse,  where would you want to be? Let's go to a mall because it's got everything in it. It's  the perfect place to get. Those are the spencers or hot topic. I guess I'm okay. Anything  with, you know, yeah.  Davey up. Day to day. Yeah. I know that is definitely your, if you've mentioned that before.  That is your favorite. That alive brain dead is a, what did put that live on here too.  Shit. What the fuck was I thinking? That would, if I had count that one, that's probably  number two for me with the rat monkey with a rat monkey. Yeah.  There's not even there.  The cute girl in that too.  No, no.  Lie.  Yes.  Lie.  Zombie flesh use.  Yeah.  Zombie.  I think I have this on that stuff down here.  It's second favorite zombie.  We've all time the makeup score.  Emus hearing that's the movie I picked up solely because of the cover, the  cover of that rotting zombies.  So I just remember to vividly seeing in the video stores back in the day.  That's how I found most of the horror movies back in the day.  just went through the horror section just if it looked cool on the cover I had to take  it home and watch it. That's how I got into return of living data actually saw that cover  I was like yeah this looks cool. Let's watch this. Yeah, that's it. You know that's what  the way it was back in the day. The people understand it's like you went to video store and  just looked at the cover you flipped it over you read a little bio and you're like okay  cool let me watch this.  Now that's kind of. Can you head now? And there it is day of the dead. There's Bob. That's  They should make a bub animatronic.  It's a price they haven't done that yet.  It got us definitely some merchandise of them though.  Yeah, they have that, but that'd be cool to have like a bub animatronic in the background.  There were some tales from the crypt episode which includes zombies like the second season episode  till death.  True, yeah.  An article practical revisit.  That's a tale may have to put down my Christmas list to share to get the whole set of  all the pictures.  there's one season that I don't have and it's like five or something like that. I have  all the DVDs of them. That's got to be streaming. Well, actually it's an HBO product. It's  probably a max, right? It's got to be. Probably. Maybe if we ever get done with Tales  from the Dark Side by the time you're 16 by the time I'm 50. Really? What do we, what is  this? Oh, should I say this Friday? I do. But they have this Friday. I'm actually in  my bands playing. So I can't. I thought we're already doing Teen Wolf coming up, right?  Is that next Saturday night, Teen Wolf?  I think that's what we told Bill.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fine.  I feel like I'm going to meet with my friends  in the lobby for the second show.  The theater manager gave us seats in the crying room.  There's four seats in the room separated by glass.  You could smoke the crying room.  Oh, you know, the church, it's funny.  The church that my kids went to in the local parish,  you know, they actually had a room behind glass.  I'm every first cone.  They're like, the last the crying room.  I'm like, the crying room?  But again, as we go with your kids,  so they don't disrupt everybody.  About the crying room.  Ha ha ha ha.  Last, David Chek tells me the crypt isn't on HBO Max,  but I think they're all available on YouTube.  I wanna, they have to have a set of all of them.  I wouldn't mind just owning the set.  I don't know.  I can't imagine taking a tail from your dark sign.  I think they did something,  but it's like a lot of them are all single,  as far as I remember.  David Brown, how you what's up, man?  Has anyone in my life?  I know. Any fans? Um, no. What does Fido have you seen Fido? I can't say I have no.  No. Tell us more about it. I don't know Fido. I mean, I know people who've named their dogs  Fido, but I didn't know there was a movie about zombies named Fido. I've been ready to  hit them. I was looking for something to watch.  For some reason, I'm thinking of the other guys and the guy from Alien in front. He's  said, yeah, fat koto.  Yeah, that's the best game.  Yeah.  Has anyone seen Fido?  Yeah, I can't say I've ever, yeah.  No, that's interesting.  Day of the dead is showing in theaters in the States at the moment for its 40th.  Is it really?  I didn't know day that that was it.  I know chainsaw massacres supposed to be in the theater.  Chainsaw because of that date and jaws is coming up in 3D or not 3D.  Max. Well, didn't, well, wasn't it the 15th? It wasn't the 15th change from Oscar date. So that passed.  I wish I would memorize it, but it's not like, uh, you know, Halloween 1978 to me.  Exactly. Fido's, uh, decent zombie fake bells. See that.  Yeah, Fat Koto's decent zombie.  Why John wants to know we can find the trick or treat box. It didn't just know what you bought.  isn't that the special episode that came out last year?  What is your?  Yeah, it's that vendor.  I forgot what company made it.  Who made it, who made it bills?  It's sign apps or whoever made that like they were,  they found some extra ones and they brought them to Flashback.  And I think he was almost sold out by the time Bill bought his, I think.  So.  Chainsaw is playing only tomorrow.  Okay, very tomorrow.  18.  Hmm.  I wonder if it's played at the theater by me.  I'll go check it out.  Yeah.  The original Pirates of the Caribbean, the Pirates of basically zombies you can have Captain  Barbados, a famous line in Elizabeth. You've got to stop being in those stories in this journey.  You're in one pirate. The original, I don't think I've never seen the original Pirates of the Caribbean.  Like the first Johnny Depp one in Orlando, Blue? Well, I think the original, isn't it the original  one before that? It wasn't. It was a Disney story. I don't know if it was in an original movie.  I should know the first part of the Caribbean Johnny Depp one is great. I think it's awesome.  But I would do see that. I had no day. The dead was gone. I have to look for that one.  Colin, I did not know that. I'd go check it out in the theater.  I went for the 50th, um, me and Terrence went. So I'm not living dead for the 50th in the theater.  And they had a whole like the first half hour was like this, um,  you can find on YouTube now. So it was like a half hour, 45 minute documentary on it.  And then they played the movie. It was awesome.  I'm trying to think I saw what did I I saw a zombie movie. I went downtown to go see Patton last year. What the hell was it?  Oh, the the original dawn of the dead. My brother. I my brother and I saw the 3d which actually wasn't that bad 3d  I'm not the biggest 3d person. Hey, you know what clear picture. No sharp  No, I'd say give it a shot if it's ever on 3d again  And this one we watched not that long ago. Oh, yeah  Yeah, maybe the dead then we had a lot of fun with it and you know watching it again  is what I had mentioned earlier where it's I don't I watched it many times back in the  day but this is the first time where I really empathize with the zombies.  Yeah, this is the first movie that made you empathize with the zombies.  Made you feel it right.  Yeah.  So Dave says the fight was a Canadian was on me comedy set in the 50s after an outbreak.  Humans figure out a way to domesticate the undead and treat them like pets.  That sounds cool as fuck.  I have to watch that.  I have to go check that out.  We will watch it tonight after this.  I have to look for it.  Oh, gee bloodline.  What's up, man?  What's happening?  The actor would play Bob in the day.  The dad is the same guy who played the guy that had the junior mitts.  So, yeah, that's right.  He was a junior mitt guy.  That was on the table.  We, uh, there's the one up there is.  What's up?  Who I forgot to, uh, leave a button.  Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, it's on to be awesome. Maybe I'll watch it tonight  Yeah, fit coat though on to be yeah, fit  I don't think you would have it on here, but I've talked about it a few different times  There's a later movie that came out. It's only  2013 called warm bodies. It's got a lot of it's kind of like a comedy slash  It's like that you've seen that the zombies are they start getting more human as they start showing feelings  So they slowly start becoming back to a human as opposed to being zombie.  John Malkovich, one of my favorites at the time, and how much she's been doing you as much  to reset Palmer if anybody's ever seen her and stuff.  And Nicholas Holt, some good people that oh, we're going to talk about later Pat, Dave  Franco, James Franco's brother.  Yes.  Dave Franco.  It's a costume this is away life, man.  What the fuck is wrong with you, man?  It's such a great line.  Who's the guy?  And we'll be doing review of this tonight. So stick around and we're watching this is our watch along for Tuesday  Because it turned 40 years old yesterday great soundtrack to this movie's got a great soundtrack  Yeah, Darren and Frank have a good best and worst over this episode. It's one of the ones I laughed at more  He's from our best and worst of this episode. I did hit him in the fucking brain  I hit that fucking brain  Hey, well, part what's up? What's shaking?  Hey, I'm the zombie beavers. It was actually more enjoyable than the name  of the zombie versus right. I forget about that.  It's my voice.  The second guy's name when he calls him when he's like trying to make  to his composure. What's the boss's name? The first name?  Oh, I can't remember. I haven't watched him so long.  No return to living dead. Oh, and they're trying to live in dead. I think  men. What's the boss's name when he calls? Hey, we have to have a problem.  on a bird. Yeah, bird. Yeah, bird.  They have sort of a problem here.  My boyfriend's back in search of zombie movie. I yeah, I think we get on here.  I actually put a buddy called on here, life after Beth because I thought that  that movie is funny as hell. And it goes to his hell.  If we're talking about, could you consider idle hands somewhat of a zombie movie?  You know what I didn't put it on here, but I don't know why not. Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, here's the remake. Good. What good fun?  I'm glad to see that this got a lot more love over the years because I mean, I saw this when I came out the theater and  Everybody just didn't seem like it whatsoever  And I don't know why you remember Pat in early 90s like this is right where this is probably some of the first like  Remakes right and somebody saw the preview for this probably is like it looks the same exact thing as the original  Which in a way it kind of is right?  but I think once people grow the sevini in  I saw his stuff.  I think it's caught.  Got momentum since this came out, I guess.  A lot of movies are like that, right?  Nobody saw office spaces at the theater, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but sometimes they find bigger lives on a home video.  Another favorite of mine is burial ground  and Italian core classic.  Some weird, asked storylines in that one,  the zombie makeup is gross.  You feel dirty after watching it.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I know, I guess I'm gonna be recommendations from Colin  on this topic.  I'm actually looking forward to the call to weather comments.  I can catch up on movies.  Oh, hell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just watched this, uh, not that long ago too.  We went, we didn't, uh, we watched it not that long ago when I  enjoyed it even more.  Cooper.  Right.  Isn't that what the guy's name is?  It lacks himself in the basement with the daughter and a wife.  That's the, uh, what do you call it?  The sheriff from house with 1000 corpses.  I can't think of his name.  I think this is the show I know.  Yeah, but one or two scenes in Happy as a Garden,  Rob Zombie's Halloween.  That's right. Yeah.  Go for it.  It is sort of a ghost and zombie movie.  Yeah, I can see.  I can see how you can relate that because they basically were zombies.  Surf 2 isn't underrated class.  They have to pull out of someone's I've never seen before.  Never saw surf 2.  I thought this would be a good topic because I figured it gets  some good recommendations on top of it.  Aside from like, you know,  the popular ones that I threw on here,  like the remake of the dead's a lot of fun too.  Now it's because of the original, but the remake is good.  Definitely have fun with this.  And this is one we have to do too.  We have to throw this on the watch long one day.  The remake is great.  Tom tolls is who you're thinking of by the way, too.  Tom tunnel to come and watch the comewash.  What?  What a fun remake, man.  I'm sorry.  And it's a.  Rick Co written by somebody who's pretty big right now.  Why can't I think of this damn name?  He did slither.  I got it just did the new Superman movies.  Why am I?  I know. I know. I know. So as we see, so you look at up here, all that guy can leave his name James gun. James  guy. There you go. Should remember that because it sounds like a porn name. Big gun.  Does James gun though hell of a nice guy and he's made some good stuff here and as much as I know you're not big into the comic book stuff is more hopefully he'll keep the DC universe at bay. So we'll see.  The original Scooby-Doo series had some episodes involved zombies like mom, Boamba and the  Voodoo.  Oh God, we can go.  Oh yeah.  That's true.  And it was always just like, let's see who it is.  They pulled a mask off and it's, yeah, I love Scooby-Doo is one of my favorite cartoons  as a kid.  I got my, I got Terrence.  I saw the hook, Don Scooby-Doo would be a bit of a kid.  Pat, it still holds up.  My kids love it.  My, uh, both my nephews love it.  I love it.  My brother loved it.  Yeah.  It's, it's kept, it's held up for some generations now.  All right, a moment of clarity here, I'll tell you guys,  I joke, not joke something funny.  So when Terrence was a, when he was younger,  and we lived still in Jersey as a matter of fact,  you know, try again to bed at night was a nightmare.  As you know, with your kids,  you just didn't want to go to sleep.  So my guy started watching Scooby-Doo movies.  He was like obsessed with Scooby-Doo,  he loves Scooby-Doo.  And I like to talk about his meeting Scooby-Doo.  So I would actually go out to the garage  and I'd call the house and pretend to be Scooby-Doo  on the phone and tell him he's got,  he should listen to his mom and dad  and he should go to sleep.  That's where they go.  And I used to do like the worst impression  that this would be due.  And he'd be like, okay, sometimes you'd be crying like,  why can't I meet you?  Yeah, the things you do for your kids.  You don't randomly came across my feet,  and I don't know if you ever heard it,  where this kid's in the car,  he gets picked up from school and some kid goes,  did you what the bed last night?  He says, check your mom's bed and find out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  Even the girl that played  The hell is bitten the one that was bitten no that she played  Yo, you we should put that you should get that brief you should get a snippet of that  Yeah, I should do the blonde girl in it opposite  Oh, you're talking to me Barbara. You mean he talked about that sort of I'll get I forget that coming to get you Bob  But yeah, she was cute and that too. Like very ramboish  She's ram bet return living dead part two. I got to watch the second one. I haven't seen the long time  Me neither I threw it on here more self in nostalgia and the fact that  We were at the fog church and it was also in this movie too  Oh, it was I forgot yep. Yeah, I'll go back and read your revisit this one, too  It's been a long time. You're thinking of Patricia Tom and who played a  Barbara and the remake.  And she was cute.  I saw the cover.  It was cool.  Yeah, the cover is awesome.  Watch the tombs of the blind dead for the first time last year.  It has a zombie, quiesadores, on horseback with swords that are pretty cool looking.  Never heard of it.  Sounds interesting though.  And how did you type conquistadores correctly with your buys and size fingers?  I thought it was spelled differently, but he got it right, I think.  I think it looks right. I just wonder how you got that with those big fingers.  Surf 2 is a 60s beach party parody. Kids turn at the zombie surf punks after ingesting a chemically  laced cola. Starring a young Eric Stoltz. Oh, I definitely, I wrote it down. I gotta check that out.  Oh, really?  What else we got here?  See, I never saw Return of Living Dead 3. Did you ever see Return Living Dead 3?  I think it's not a long time ago. I never did Kristell since say you worked on this movie. I think he did I  Never saw I threw it up there because I'm like you know, I don't remember  Was this street to video?  I can't see this being theatres. I thought the cover is pretty cool  It's got it looks pretty damn cool. I'm like I might when I was looking at the picture and I was like  So you never saw it? No, I never saw it  Eddie these and isn't surf too the Simpsons stole the plot from the movie for their games  I'm interested in creating a project.  Any decent.  Isn't any decent the geek that got always  placed the geek?  He does a lot of voice acting.  He was in Greece.  He was in the fuckers.  He got a movie.  I remember he was in 1941.  I think that's him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Councils.  Yeah.  Chris Nelson worked on that one.  Yeah.  I have to go check it out.  I've not seen.  I've never lived in Dead 3 is one that got better  for Bill with age.  It was Chris Nelson's first movie he worked on.  Sorry.  It's getting better.  That is it, I thought that was it.  Yep.  Chris Nelson did work after he talks about it a little bit on the things I had.  Yeah, that's the worst thing.  I'll go back and check it out.  And there it is.  Now that was the most iconic Azzambi look at cover.  Yeah, this one, you got to, this is a classic.  What we should put, like I said, maybe when we get around to it, to order some of  watch along.  Because to some rate because this August is ramp and it's gonna be fricking Halloween season for you now  I mean it's already Halloween season for some people Halloween season right now. I would want to watch this before I do a watch on  Guess this is another one that's been a long time  Yeah, I would have to revisit it and before I get a really good two to death with it  Yeah, very just know he's something was wrong features of zombie who doesn't realize that he's dead  Hmm, no  They ever did they ever turn into a film or anything. I mean that plot sounds familiar  No, I know this is I know you're big fan of Folchies zombie epic. Yep  They had some cool shirt to this too. They came out that long. Oh, I should have picked up a shirt  Zombie land now. This is if this was one this one special me and my son why love this movie  We used to watch all the time together zombie land  First movie I saw after I came back for my honeymoon. I love zombie land probably top five I counted the zombie movie  even though it's a comedy. Yeah, it's just such a classic, it's such good lines in it. I like  how it tells, you know, all the different things you should do in the zombie apocalypse.  And the Bill Murray scene is just priceless. Makes that whole movie. Oh, God, yeah.  And even does on the land? Double tap. I was used the first one. But still fun.  still fun. Yeah, it was, you know, kind of a letdown for some part of it, but yeah, it's  still worth it entertaining. Yeah, it was definitely fun. It's from the anthology books  you're scary stories to tell in the dark. Oh, okay. Say them. I never read any of those.  I know I saw the movie that came out. I didn't think much of the movie. The movie  was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. The books I read, those books  I don't know if I was a kid.  I'll do the back and revisit it.  I started in the theater with, I think my daughter.  And somebody brought back the scary stories I thought.  I remember seeing it advertised at a con.  Sorry, my eyes are bothering me.  Cry?  Yeah, crying, laughing, you know.  Favorite zombie movie scores in the pose that go.  I'll be the first to say goblin, just to get it out there.  Zombie movie scores.  I'm not too familiar with the scores, but it'd be something cool to visit and composers.  I mean, I know all the soundtracks and then I mean, I would have to say,  we're trying to live in Dead simply because just the group of bands that are in  there just all. I mean, one of my favorite bands of all time is T. S.  Well, T. S. Well was on that. And that was big at the time for me. I was like,  whoa. T. S. Alex, you made it in a movie. That's a tough question. Yeah.  Too much about me neither. As that's then it intrigues me. Like to the point where I  have to investigate it. Colin has two thoughts. Masks from Fultie zombie.  Definitely some of their better masks. I didn't even know that. Tots made them. That's  awesome. I mean, just so much shit now. Yeah, me and Mike were watching this show and we  really liked it. We have to go finish it. The Santa Clarita diet was an awesome zombie show  starring Barry Moore and Timothy Olafant that ended way too soon. Yeah, we were watching  the Netflix, wasn't it? I was, no, we watched it on his not so legal service that he has,  but we were watching that and we were really enjoying it. We were watching that and we  I want to talk with the whole show we watched and that we have to get on.  The one with the girl from, from, uh, what the fuck is it?  Yeah. The big nang theory where they start a podcast with a real serial killer.  Did you see that?  You lost me, huh?  You never saw that. It's a two. It's some show.  And the storyline is it's the girl that plays Penny. I can think of her real name.  and she plays her and her husband  want to start a podcast and she's only to like serial killer stuff and they find  a real serial killer that's out there killing and the cops have any of the  found them and they start a whole podcast with him.  That sounds familiar.  It's a good show.  I have to go back and finish it but we have to finish to consider clear it for  really diet too.  It sounds a lot of fun.  I saw that, yeah, the yuck mouth opened up for T. as well.  when Sean was posting all this stuff and he showed the bill, I'm like, oh, dude, he's freaking  playing with TSOL. One of my favorite bands. I'm so, I'm like, I'm jealous.  Did you, uh, did you watch him with his tasting of his foods? Or is that not your kind of  watch? I watched it today. I had it on the background when I was doing some stuff. Yeah, that,  I don't know, man. There's a fair near here by me that they have every year, the Wayne County  Fair and they do you know, and they have, you know, it's carne food, but there's some weird  shit food that he finds in that place. Man, that's some crazy shit.  Bill and I were going back and forth because that chasing green.  Dude, that guy makes me laugh. So hard.  He gets off with like that grab a tron thing.  He's like, I didn't even know we were spinning.  I don't know. We're just talking.  I'm like, this is a rib, right? This is a joke. There's no way.  Yeah. I remember I told his show on everyone's,  so while I threw it on the other night, because who do you have live?  Oh, yeah, exact wild on the other night. Oh, no kidding. Okay. Yeah. So I threw it on I was watching the background. It was some interesting guess  I messaged them. I would have to know like that place is probably got to have some goofy alcohol drinks too  If it's got all the other goofy other food and drinks a  Pickled Dr. Prepper. Did you see that? Oh, oh  Yeah, some of stuff he was eating. I'm like, oh my goodness a brave man. I wouldn't eat some of that shit. Well, dude  I I would totally try that  that's the hot Cheetos Twinkie Smashburger.  That's right, we're just saying.  I don't know, man.  My ass just quivering thinking about that.  That would kill me.  What movie was she in?  With, oh,  why movie with Kayleigh Cawoko?  That's the one that's Penny.  But the TV show was a show, it was on,  I don't know, it was on one of streaming services,  where she does the podcast thing.  The best thing with Kayleigh Quokko is in why him  when she's the voice, like the Alexa voice in the background  and that rich guy's house.  That's what we use, that's terrible.  It's not particularly good, but garden of the dead  is memorable for having the preacher from Halloween four  and people that turn at the zombies from  in Hailey from Al behind.  Well, I can see that.  So, so Reverend Jackson P. Sarah's is in the?  Isn't Reverend Jackson P. Sarah's an ex-Kape for New York too?  where he keeps on calling on chief.  Isn't that the same guy?  Easy of their chief in the theater.  The theater's married.  I think that's him, yeah, you're right.  I bet that was the same guy.  That's it, based on a true story.  That's the name of the show with Kayleigh Cuoco  where they start a true crime podcast about a serial killer.  It's a good show, it's fun.  We have to get back and watch it.  I know what my-  Whoa, this was, what's the issue is this song?  Oh, it's on Petecock.  You want to talk?  to  but I was highly intoxicated.  So.  And I, I was just exhausted from last couple of days before that,  walking around the con.  So in the coming home and one day doing all.  Yeah.  Cause I got, cause the wife, I guess, said she was away last night  cause my daughter went back to school.  So she went with her, set her up in a new apartment,  and she stayed over.  So my band played yesterday afternoon.  And then by the time that was over, I hang out at the bar  and then before I was not pointing at the happen,  I said, let me go before I drank a little bit too much.  I don't want to be driving. So got back here. So drinking more beer. One of my mics drank more beer there. Oh my god. What time are you up until late?  Huh?  No, I actually wasn't up to too late because I was pretty I was pretty glad I lost my freaking glasses. I don't know what the  Funkie do with them.  Because I have a pair of your glasses too.  I always lose a pair. That's why I have I because they're all cheater. Not they just cheat us. I have  Stacked on all other places. I was losing.  It was a bad day for glasses because I lost my sunglasses at the show that was playing at  the TV.  I lost my favorite cheaters.  I lost them.  I don't know where they are.  I thought maybe they fell off my head between my house and his house, but I didn't see  them on the ground anywhere.  I felt my dogs are quite creative.  One killed one of the Michael Myers stuffies one way and then the other one killed another  way.  Well, that's his name.  Yeah, Carmen Flippy.  Flippy, Flippy, Flippy.  Yeah, I always remember his weird last name.  is that all you're using Sandflakes too.  Yeah, but it's, well, as Tar of Hands,  you'll always be Reverend Jackson Peace Air.  Yeah, it ain't just.  Dave got this in goblin performing Knoxville  times he last year for a demon's retrospect.  They performed the score with the film  in the background at the end of the,  they performed one of the dead mashup.  That's cool as hell.  Where?  Another kick on.  I wonder if that guy pet is Reverend Jackson Peace Air.  Is that, that's not the same guy in the one-merd  with children episode that tries to rip him off  the bottle opener when they're stuck in the desert. Remember that one? Oh, I have to go back  and look. I know the episode by time. I'm starting to see his face. It might be. It looks  like him in a Jefferson like they have a bottle opener is pocket for the Coca-Cola machine.  You have to go to that. I don't know if you guys have ever played it.  No, no, no, no, no. There was a horror video game called zombies. He hit my neighbors.  that I don't know because I was I tuned at once I tuned at a  political vision. Oh, actually the first Sega system I should say. So that was  an early eight. I don't saw that.  I don't know.  I remember it's last year Fred. I believe I played it on super Nintendo or Genesis.  That was that era.  Is it neighbor or parents? He said zombie at my neighbors.  Eight my neighbors. Sorry.  Okay. I do remember the game though. Sorry.  Yes, he did. Yeah, he was on mere good children.  That was him. Okay. I was going to go look it up. That's it. Yeah. So Bill will not  last night, watch it, making the Teen Wolf females. So next Saturday night, folks, join  us as we celebrate it's 40 years. Right? 85. Yes, I didn't wear my Teen Wolf shirt yet. So I  make sure I wear that. Yeah. So with next Saturday night, we're doing a 40th anniversary watch  along with Teen Wolf and the bills joining us live. So tune in. Probably set the stream up  tonight. So you'll see it on the channel. Teen Wolf. Yeah. And I don't know if you have one of  of those movies that you watched over and over and over  and over and over again at a young age.  That was probably one of my movies I watched over and over.  But you're working off?  Yeah.  Maybe aside from Halloween, it was probably Animal House,  the Lou's Brothers, of course.  Flatch, Jesus Christ, I watch Flatch a million times.  Watch clue a million times too,  but that thanks to my sister.  Clue will be doing it in December.  Well, make sure we get my sister on for that.  We're going to be sure we can.  No, that'd be fun.  It said his shirt.  Oh, I'm pretty sure.  Talking of the cock, I just watched a new great documentary  on Richard Ramirez.  The Lost Tape's definitely worth a watch.  One of the better ones for him.  Interesting.  Yeah, I love, I got to tell my daughter.  My daughter is the scaring me for a while.  She was like, I've said to serial killers  when watching documentaries on them.  I watched Colin.  I watched Richard Ramirez special that was on Netflix.  It was a multi-part one with the detective  talking about it.  Dude, I knew of that.  I was very young when that happened, Pat.  but I didn't realize how nasty that guy was.  Holy cow.  What guy I am starting reading the chat?  Richard Ramirez.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, cool.  Well, he did.  And how disgusting.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  It was in pretty.  Did you ever see that he was on the episode of the dating game?  They showed it.  Yes.  And that documentary on that.  And they would have one day with him,  didn't go on it because she felt he was too creepy  that it was something weird about it.  So she didn't go on the date with him.  Oh, well, blame.  David Brown was asking about the scare fest in Kentucky.  I think our friend Cody Snyder, he must be out and about.  Is Joe going this year?  As far as I don't Joe has said anything to me  because that one would be more realistic to go  than the horror hounds for next month now.  But I would probably only make the horror hounds  wouldn't work if something changed with you,  but I know that's probably, yeah,  You know, you got a lot of stuff.  I got much going on.  I'd love to.  But I pretty much after, after  Liberty weekend, I think I have  something booked every, I've had to do  there's a job at work that it's got to be done  in the weekend and I've been putting  it off almost a month now and they're like,  Pat, when are you gonna come do this?  I'm like, I haven't had a free fucking weekend.  So I can't do it until the second week in September.  Because every weekend is just booked.  I have something going on every fucking weekend.  Better get it done, Pat.  Better get it done.  I got to get it done, man. Yeah. I was a team wolf. Alan.  Unless I'm a team wolf, that's gonna be fun. Yeah. Yeah.  Maybe they're side team will afford for word on Saturday.  I didn't tell you, Pat, though. I think I've told you the story when so that we met Michael  J. Fox right after Lisa went and never mentioned and that was like one of his first  conventions he ever did. And I had the team wolf shirt on and I got that signed instead of a  back to the future item. He was like, Oh, wow. I think he saw something different. Yeah, exactly.  Oh, anyways. Yeah. Oh, so, yeah, he knows which document I'm talking about that.  Oh, that's right. It was the other guy Rodney Alcala. That's it. That's the guy who won that.  That was Ramirez. I thought it was Ramirez too, because I've seen a documentary about that too.  Yeah, I must be getting a mixed up two cats. Yeah, he too. I could have swear it was him.  I did not know that because where it was.  I just get a kick.  They had like the helicopter following him from like bust a bus.  Trying to get away.  It was like a huge long chase.  She didn't want the video today and the guy was at a con called mid summer  scream. Yeah, I've heard of it. And John Carpenter was there.  Yeah, so Carpenter said he's still doing some cons. I didn't think he was doing  some.  Scream was this weekend. I thought that was the one, isn't that the one that's in Orange  County? I think it was the con this weekend. I think so.  PJ souls because I met Russell's there with  Oh, that's right. I saw Matt's posts. Yeah. He's so pictures with  yeah, I hope that's okay. Matt has a bit in our chat. Oh, wow. That's good.  I don't blame him. I have to message him and  I'm speaking of our buddy Joe. This is his favorite movie right here.  Shauna the dead.  Shauna that's fun. There's no sad about it. I like the second one better  which might not be too popular by many people, but hot fives. I like hot fives more.  We talked about watching it.  I don't remember.  How we talked about it, but how does this do it?  That's pretty wild.  It is good.  I thought we talked about doing it, I guess we didn't do it.  No, we do it as it's going to blow up.  I want to call off.  If we do it, definitely have to have Joe on for that one.  Only if this wasn't the preseason, Pat, the bears are winning.  This one was fun.  This one was fun. I only watched this one not that long ago. Did you ever see this?  Is that what's her name?  Um, that's not the comedian chick, right?  No, this is um, the hell is her name. I'm helping some chat if you know it.  I watched this not that long ago. It was on Pluto and I never even saw it.  So this is his girlfriend she gets killed and then she comes back as a zombie.  And it's funny as hell.  Yeah, that's all replaza. Okay, it is.  I did this here, okay.  Yeah, this is funny.  John C. Riley's in this Paul Reiser, who I just met.  You never saw me.  I never even heard of it.  It was on Pluto probably a couple of months ago.  And I put it on and I was watching it and I might just  move these funny as fucking hell.  Yeah, this one's worth checking out.  It's a lot of fun.  We got to watch that movie, Miss March.  That's the one I want to watch with you.  I picked it when that's the last slide I have.  But yeah.  Let's move this over here.  What's up there?  Oh, it's only on prime.  How the hell is that happening?  Anyways, it's a similar plot.  Yeah, that you've seen over and over at movies,  but I just I've never even heard of it and it came on.  And I was like, this movie is funny as all hell.  I enjoyed it.  If we, I don't mean to change subject.  If we end up seeing anybody good in December,  it's still CityCon.  We could always revisit getting together for that too  because I know it's like a halfway point for you of me too.  to just.  That's in December.  Oh, yeah.  December not so bad.  I don't know anything.  December.  December is actually so far is open.  Yeah.  So that that might work.  Yeah, that could definitely work.  But we'll see.  We'll see who shows up there because then we can always get the Romero stuff like the  Taylor Swift dark side stuff.  September's scattered, but October and November is just books.  Howling.  Jesus.  It's Port solid.  Solid.  Yeah.

Yeah, I did not know that I  Like you said, I'm out of it, but I knew he wrote it. I did was not aware that he actually  Directed it too. Yeah, this was like his claim of fame as a director  He only did two other things called bloodbath in 1969 which is a looks like a short movie and the resurrected for a  1991 so  Yeah, there's a lot of memories of a time living dead because like I said, I knew  the soundtrack was a big thing for me.  You know, probably around 83, 84s when I found the band T.S. well.  And then when I found that they were going to be on the soundtrack,  I remember going to see in the theater,  and I thought it was so much fun.  It was great hearing all that stuff.  I remember this is probably around the time when I was in my punk rock phase,  doing I was writing a skateboard, and it was right in the middle of the 80s  and the skateboard craze.

Who was in, I remember in 1941, I love it.  It's set a small world here, home on vintage.  And then of course you had Demon,  our Friday 13th part five buddy was in there.  Who else?  The guy, the one punk guy with the Christian,  uh...  what he called the  with the uh...  the fuck is it  why am i trying to like gone uh...  back to the future  make flyman  mister make fly  oh you're talking about uh...  you should be in the state  a ten  right yeah  christian what mike and my mom i don't like his last name  now you made me draw  complete black of his last name  That's that Christian.

His hair cut in that the guy in the  return of living dead that has the same  hair cut. He was just, he was in point  break. So he was in point break,  which was great. Actually, I was just  watching point break the other night.  The OG and who else is in there?  Of course, Linnea quickly, famously gets  naked, but she's really not naked.  If you find out if you actually watch  the return of living dead documentary.  You'll find out she was wearing like a bodysuit,  which totally killed it for me,  because I thought she was fully new.  So such characters, soundtrack,  memorable scenes, fun story,  the apocalyptic ending at the end of it,  because it doesn't have an ending,  because it's just gonna get worse,  because of what they did.  And you also have the kernel in there.  The guy who was actually deep on  from  Halloween 3 season of the witch and  Great characters this this movie for me  do this this is this is uh  This movie is just about perfect movie for me. So this is like a 9.5 movie for me easy  We got our share of how or Friday the 13 people here right with Tom Matthews and  What's this up Miguel at new news right? Yeah, man. That is  Yeah, that's a 9.5 for me, dog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is I just when I saw this, I didn't expect it to be a comedy, right?  Like that whole beginning with Tom Matthews and James Caron is so funny.  So good.  It's so funny.  And just when they got that body out, right, like out of the unlocked and they're screaming,  like,  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  What a asshole yeah, we said he was in something too, right? Halloween 3 he was the bomb at Halloween 3 gets his head pulled off  Well, that's the same guy. Yeah, boy  Hey, what's up hurt what's she aching? Hey, Herbert? Yeah, you know, I guess I'm just gonna go simple 9 on it. It's so much fun  just it's  Lot of memories and watches for the first time just laughing you know  It's good about this movie if you don't watch it like I  I enjoyed more fun to watch it all the time.  You know, a lot of people can watch this over again.  Like if I watch this, like, you know, once,  like every couple of years,  I seem to like it a bit more.  If I put it on repeat, I'm afraid,  like I'd get worn out with it, you know?  Yeah, it's not a movie I put on a lot  because it's the same, yeah, I don't wanna wear it out.  It's just, it's a fun thing to do every so often.  That's why in the last time I,  I think the last time I watched it was probably  or watch along.  Yeah.  It was like, it was over a year ago.  And how about his sacrifice into movie, right?  It's like so damn emotional.  That music, remember the music when he's putting himself in through the chamber?  Burn the flames.  Yeah.  Oh, God, remember the paramedics are checking them.  You should be dead.  This tells me you're dead.  But...  Yes, I know.  do nothing beats when they bring the group, the limbs all like chopped up to what's the  guy's name again?  Ops Earl.  Next door in Ernie like they lived, remember they opened up the bag, he's like, where  was I, somebody was bringing it up somewhere where they said he was supposed to be like  a like a Nazi guy in hiding.  That's why he had like the Nazi music playing and he had like a lute like a, I can see  that. I'm somewhere where did I hear that? I don't know. I could see that. And the guy with the  dozerring or you know, or the with the earrings right, the punkie guy with the crazy haircut. He's  been in some stuff right? Wait, he was in Halloween, not Halloween, part five, Friday, 35.  What you told me right? I was asking him. I thought that was his name. The guy plays Chuck, right?  Not the same guy. I think you're really out of line. Vic.  That's the same guy. Vic, Vic, the guy you played Vic is him.  The dude actually gets his head eaten by the the slimmer.  It's a hard one. You got a line. I think you really have a line. Vic.  Herbert's watching his favorite 80s slash or problem that I just watched problem  That's another movie I put on a lot.  That's just a comfort food.  The OG prom night.  I just love that movie.  Burt.  Um, Burt.  Burt.  That's gonna be so much fun watching that.  I was trying to find that Walmart exclusive steelbook  because I just have a regular DVD of that Jesus Christ.  You can't do that.  You're gonna give Pat a heart attack to the enemy too.  You can't do that the Pat.  Please apologize, Tom.  I'm sorry.  That's okay buddy. You scared? You scared me?  Oh my god, you scared somebody audience. Where are you going?  Okay.  Hey, he only cost me. He only cost me 80 dollars. He only cost me 80 dollars at the  contest today. He just...  You saw it?  He was a little bamboo samurai sword. Not like the metal one. You know, that would be...  I'd be going to jail if I gave him a hug.  I'm gonna tell you his mom that would have done that.  I gave him a, he got a bamboo, one made a bamboo so he could even bring it to not the school of course, but to another kind if you wanted to.  Oh, I'd be that guy, but there's a hit definitely since Bryant Peck is in it or does it bother you. Oh, yeah, didn't you get convicted? Was he like a sex offender or something?  He did something with a, I did, did they catch me to sting or something like that if I remember correctly.  Uh, burnt.  Um, now it's a, um, burn.  Yeah, I'm the same way. You got to separate it. Yeah, because it's a movies portraying a character and I get that. Yeah, that's just  Yeah,  Don't living dead is almost like either a sequel or a spoof of Night Living Dead. Oh, that's basically what is meant to be. I mean, it's not really part of the Romero movies because  Romero didn't do it, but yeah, he's right about the actor Brian Peck. I remember hearing that. Yeah, I remember like it's like he was like a sex offender, right?  All right. Yeah, he pleaded. What's this say here?  Perfect.  Fred's going to go change his trousers after that jump scare.  I'm actually recollecting my thoughts.  You really scared the crowd bad.  I mean, that's awesome.  That's awesome.  Yeah, please, no conscious of charges of committing a Luddak against the child 14 or 15  in oral completion of verse and under 16 he was convicted and received a set to 16  months. It was ordered to register as a sex offender. So okay.  I fucking smell what people I really don't know.  He was pen pals with John Wayne Gacy even had a painting against his alter ego  program. The clown of Gacy made form. Wow. Wow. Okay.  Wow. Why?  Yeah, the civilian remake was great. Yeah, we talked about that earlier. It's a lot of fun.  And we got a new extended cut coming out of that and that might have to be something we explore.  Even I know a lot of the figure that I was pat if he's not getting to have that edition, but that'll be fun to check out.  Yeah. Was a big deal because he was in the Fender Associated with Nickelodeon and I think one of his victims was Drake.  Real? I doubt I did not know. How was he associated with Nickelodeon? Did he work there or something?  I saw a lot of Drake and Josh.  I was one of those favorite shows when he was a kid.  You know, I forgot to tell you about that I wanted to.  I said when I wait his line.  I wanted to get Rob Schneider to sign my dude's big little poster.  So whenever what's the same comes around again.  Our buddy from Halloween, Rob Zombie's Halloween.  He's my reason to do big loads of detective.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell is the guy for?  Yeah.  Well, you're in foresight.  Yeah.  What's mad?  Jelsie, you don't know what his A is?  Look at this dick, right?  It's like it's no, it's bad.  It's bad.  I haven't seen two spigelow in forever.  Two spigelows fun.  Oh, it's great.  I just haven't seen it in forever.  Actually, my school.  Yeah, let us know.  That's our review of Return of Living Dead.  Let us know in the comments.  Yeah, sorry.  We don't.  We're going to be watching it on.  We will be watching it this Tuesday  for our watching long to celebrate 40 years.  This Tuesday, be there.  He worked. Oh, so yeah, he worked at Nickelodeon. Okay. It's all in that docuser is quiet on set.  Oh, because that was that J. G. Michael was that the show that Amanda Bines did us episode of about Amanda Bines. I think on that. Yeah.  Where is that show?  Quiet on. So what's the different episodes?  The show with just yeah, all the scandals with child actors. Yeah, there's the Amanda Bines one. They.  I don't think you think it was past your Nickelodeon time, but the show hey dude, like you know the main girl is  Christine Taylor that's been stillers for life life. She does a podcast with the one guy Ted from hey dude. Oh, I loved her  She was great. No, she was she was Marcia in the Brady bunch. What we should have this out. Yeah, and she was in  She was in the zoo lander movies with his husband. Yeah, and she was uh, she played the  the girl who shaved her head in the friends episode that was hooked up with Ross.  She used to shave her head.  She was friends with Phoebe.  She said, no, I'll set you up with my friend.  She said, what the ball chick?  She said, tell her.  She had hair.  So they go on this trip and Rachel wants to get back with Ross so she convinces her to  shave her head again.  She comes back and he's like, oh, her burden.  knows they do it. Yeah, they're they they talk in their podcasts.  They've been trying to find Danny forever. They can't find Danny.  Danny's never done anything else other than he do.  There's a whole documentary about the Nickelodeon scandal. It's on Max  or Netflix. Oh, scandal has been gone to the very neighbor kid from  better off dead really Ricky from better off dead.  Ricky. What the hell is he? What did he do? Did he do something like?  Cause he never saw that guy again. I mean, I don't ever ever see me in  anything. Yeah, Ricky, G Ricky and real sorry, a mom blew up.  10. I did not I think I watch all this shit.  Probably because are you afraid of darkness from the can away from crazy California?  I'm not going to argue with you there.  You know, I'm very still, I mean, I'm funny are  right in the darkness problems. Yeah, well, that's well, everything's  something that we can now or in the south, the southeast.  Oh, absolutely. Georgia Carolinas.  Yeah, oh shit. I didn't do my top five. What's on?  Jamie Lee Curtis looking like that on the set of something.  Huh? For what? What was that? Was that from whatever that picture I sent you?  With her and the musk look. Oh, yes. Okay.  Maybe that was that show on about the Chicago restaurant because she's on that, right?  She's on that.  What's the bear?  Yeah, she's been on the bear.  Yeah.  Did not know that.  So I'm doing my top five.  I knew which one I had a button.  I'm just a bit nervous.  Herbert, I don't remember that episode, but I watched he do.  And it's something I should probably revisit somewhere down the road where it's at.  I do the name of the show, but I didn't because it took a little bit too old.  I could have sworn I'd danced my son if he watched it.  Maybe that's where I've heard it.  one second let's see if I can hold on here who was the star in that move in that  show I wasn't really one like I think you could probably say Christine Taylor was  like the one that like really kind of became something of it you'd figure the  forget what it is that the things on yeah I'm gonna get things we're gonna get  you to overloads of the show  okay  sorry so tonight we're gonna do our top five thing our top five body horror  movies oh just like I said we'll probably talk about it fresh off of me watching  together the other night with with Mike and so you found together but you did  not find the other one yet did you?  No, no, it's like a cam footage one.  So we're waiting to find the way  the little bit longer to get the real one on there.  So yeah, I think it's the C weapon jet.  Okay, okay.  And if he doesn't like that movie,  I'll be like to have a role that's going on buddy.  What's going on with you?  Need the talk.  Yeah, we wanted to watch that one,  but yeah, we have to wait and see until it pops up.  But let's do our top five tonight.  So our top five, Bobby horror, let's do it.  Yeah.  Alright, so tonight we're doing our top five body horror movies and you can do a lot of  movies you can say we're fringe on the edge of body horror but since all subjective to  so I just picked you know movies that I definitely knew were body horror that I liked.  Yeah.  I'll go first.  My number five is exactly what we just talked about the movie together.  If you've not seen together, there's some seriously weird shit that goes on in that film.  And there's a match with Pat Knight and that. That's my number five as well. Yeah.  I think maybe now Pat, I don't know, you probably don't feel different, but  can you see how those two are actually really together in real life, like how that movie  panned out in their performances? Could you see how. Yeah, yeah, now I can definitely see another  thing you mentioned that they're actually married in real life. There's like a six or seven year  different. She's older than him. But yeah, that guy is either she pisses you off or he pisses  you off. I think he might have pissed me off more than she did. But he doesn't have the  most because she's cute as hell and he's having spoiler alert here if he's not seeing it. I'm not  gonna reveal everything. But you know, he's in this like funk where he doesn't want to have sex with  her. And all she wants to do is have sex. It's like dude, that's wrong with you. Don't take a pill.  It's just a way to talk about what happens when they do.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I was waiting for that.  We both called that when it happened at the school in the stall.  Yeah, you want to see me quiver in a theater seat screaming?  Thank God nobody else is in that theater besides my brother.  I was like, oh, that's beautiful.  Oh, the holy crap.  You saw that coming too.  No pun intended.  I was actually, some people might not like the ending of that movie, but I thought it worked.  It didn't go in the direction you thought it first, but then it did.  And then it went, it did a little bit of a little swipe turn, right?  That's probably the best way to say it.  Yes.  Number five for college.  Scanners.  Great movie.  Yes, slash your friend.  I wanted, I could really put RoboCop in here.  I didn't.  The fly may or may not be on my list.  Baskey case. Yeah, that didn't make my list best. That's true. We have by best case was I  Remember renting that we talked about earlier about renting movies from the theater  And I don't remember renting that and getting it home and be like this my food thinks this shit up  Yeah, I you know because it together the fly fell off of my list  I'm so sad about that. I know that's kind of crazy  Shivers is another good one, too. Look at that. Councilor. I asked you anyone since I'm a on my list here, but it's good  What did you do is your number four? I'm sorry? I'll do number four  So for me my number four is video drum. Oh, oh  Get that love video drum. I was one of the movies. I love from the 80s another one  I found in a video store that I just rented and because I didn't know anything about it and I saw Debbie Harry was attached to it  Which is blondie and  Watch that and I remember always used to be on late night on cinamax too. It was always on cinamax really  Yeah, so video drum if you're not seeing it long live the new flesh is it  This is a laugh.  The movie James Woods, Debbie Harry, creepy weird Crona Berg film.  My number four, it's really only bodyry horror mode of just one character.  We just talked about it.  James Franco's slither.  I can't wait.  We haven't watched it, but we need to watch slither together.  I think we'd have a lot of fun about that.  I've not seen it.  I got to check it out.  Do you haven't seen that, Pat?  Really?  No.  Society.  Society?  No.  I don't know that one.  It's slitting out.  I never got about to see that.  I could have put that alive on here.  It's one of my favorite movies.  I don't know why I just don't think  of a body order even though clear as day is.  Yeah, I know I almost put in the realm of zombies,  but I can see body horror for that, definitely.  Bill's number four is the substance yet.  That's definitely on my list.  It's coming.  Yeah, it's coming.  It's coming, it's right.  Definitely the epitome of body horror right there.  Absolutely.  All right, so number three for me is where's my number three?  Oh, speaking of, I think,  I know three is the substance like just like bills number four that moving just I  Mean it was such a buzz about it and then when I finally watched it  I was just like first of all it's a great movie. She deserved the nomination nomination as did  What the hell is the other girls?  I'm coming out with it from the one-tone brother  And because I mean she really put herself out there to me more in that movie, so she actually definitely deserved it  There's a lot of fun  Only thing is it just it probably just went a little bit too far like the last 20 minutes didn't need to be there  That last 10 or 15 minutes was out of this world. It was just crazy. I might that's where that's where it you know  It jumped the shark so to speak because I was like really  This is just a little bit much here  Yeah  But good movie love that movie and yeah all the praise of God. It's nice to see that it got all that praise so  Well, I'm sure you're coming up for you  but the thing is what falls right in my number three slot. There's no doubt about it.  Groundbreaking for its time. I really, this movie probably would have done a lot better if it didn't  come out around the same time as ET. I think that what really killed it a bit and Carver  didn't got so much shit about this movie and now, like most people say it's one of his best movies.  So yeah, the thing, number three. Yeah, they did not see that. If we go check that one out, that's  that's one of the buildings.  90s body horror, rich people's sucking,  actually shape shifting and sucking the poor dry.  Interesting concept.  Dr. Giggles is, I haven't seen that movie in ages.  Oh.  There's an ever-skated song based on the movie's leather.  Cool, that's cool, but.  Oh.  If it's on one of those CDs I've got,  I just put those, I came across the CDs  who had given me the last year or two.  So.  number two for Colin is dead and buried for me one.  Well, Ted and buried. I've seen dead and buried.  That's actually an older one I've seen.  Very cool. All right, so.  Number two right number two.  Now correct the Monday.  Yep.  So what I know these are orders.  See, this was my number two.  Oh, number two for me is.  Reanimator.  Oh, look at that. Yep.  One of my favorite movies of all time,  love that, love me some Barbara cramped in that.  To be a severed head in that film would have been beautiful.  If you know, you know.  That movie just, I mean, even the hell is his name?  Who plays Robert West?  Have we loved the guy?  What is that guy that Sean was telling Bill and I about  how we talked?  You're talking about Jeffrey Combs?  Jeffrey Combs, he's just so great in that.  He really, really is.  Who's gonna believe a talking kid?  Get a job.  Get a job.  Yeah, love, love, love, reanimate.  Jeffrey Combs, yep, there it is.  We never did a watch a long reanimator.  We gotta do that.  That and from beyond too, we should really do.  Oh, from beyond Jesus.  Somebody mentioned from beyond the peer too, yeah,  but oh, yeah, number three from beyond for Colin.  Oh, she's just amazing in that.  She's amazing in anything.  Sorry.  even as the mom in your next she was hot.  Wow, okay.  My number two,  some people might not consider it body horror,  but to me, it's Claire's day's body horror,  and it's a great film.  It's one of Eli Ross,  early films called Cabin Fever, baby.  Oh, Cabin Fever, nice.  You see some good stuff from the ladies  in this movie too, so.  Yeah, no complaints there.  But just to think of what,  where this is all coming from, right?  as you start to collect them where there's some sort of, yeah.  Yeah, that's all I'll say.  Name an old tree too, Freddy's Revenge,  Freddy bursting out of Jesse.  Oh, definitely.  Number two for Bill Hellraiser, yeah.  I didn't even, I'm not a big hellraiser guy.  So that's probably, I don't know.  I just always forget about that franchise.  That didn't mean anything for me.  By the way, I got it before I forget to ask you.  Did, did strict, my strict mentality was going  at the Friday 13th convention or did maybe I missed that and he posted all those pictures.  I think he mentioned it to me or maybe did that in the chat when he came in our chat.  Something like that.  All those pictures. I was like, oh, damn, look like he had a good time.  Yeah, look like fun. Glad he went. That looks like fun. I haven't seen a lot of that's  the only person I've seen online with post a picture from it. I didn't see anybody post  anything from it.  Especially our California friends that didn't really know. I know although, uh,  Lido said why he didn't so yeah, he was busy with work so  anyways and  Colin I have a match my number one the fly 86. I mean come on you can't get any more than that  Old one stuff oh god. Nuts in man reanimator video drone extra. Oh yeah, but yeah for me number one is the fly  I  I just because now it's the only movie I'm gonna think of so much with body horror.  And I'm my number once in some since I just...  I think...  I think, Demi Moore, I'm so glad she did this film.  I think it really showed a different side of her.  And I really...  I think it extended her career doing this movie.  Oh, the revitalizer career goes...  I mean, she wasn't necessarily dead in the water,  because she just wasn't doing a lot.  Like, she was on landman, but she's got such a small role,  which I think that's going to change now in this next season that's going to be coming on in November so  probably yeah that's okay Oscar nominee here let's put her in some more shit  heck yeah but yeah if you could have done some with the last 15 minutes differently  I just you and I talked about it if Ray Lee ordered in die he was that role of Dennis Kued which  I could totally see but Dennis Kued was a great replacement though  And it's great. Yeah. I mean, that's, you know, sometimes you can't see how somebody, but I could totally have seen Ray Leode in that position as well.  He could pull it off, but Dennis. Great.  Yeah.  Like he's a lot of it.  I don't want to do a lot of definitions for body.  Horry. Yeah. Like God, I think even built when we were watching Frightnite with him,  like you could even count like a little bit of Frightnite as body.  We're our transformations.  that might be a better thing to do next time maybe is our best body horror scenes or transformations maybe.  I don't know like pick our significant scenes from that.  Yeah, here's one right here when David turns into a werewolf in the American werewolf in London.  That scene was groundbreaking at the time especially.  Oh yeah. Hey, Leanna. What's going on?  Hi, Leanna. Hey, happy Sunday.  little Nicky is body horror. Harvey Gotts, though, gives Kevin the Ewan boobie's  eyes. That's true. Bill's like, oh, drats. I forgot the fly. But that is number  three and shift everything lower down a peg. Sorry. Yeah, see, I was thinking  about doing it that way too, Bill, but I just kept that as a runner up. Yeah, the  fly is just such a great movie. That's a movie. I'm surprised we haven't done it  watch along yet. Tusk is another one. Another decent body horror movie.  I can't tell. Tusk is a good one. Tusk is a good one.  Yeah. Behold fish boy. Tusk is a rough. That's how body horror is done with 80 cars  Oh.  Thanks.  There it is.  Elliot posted.  Did you just naps?  Go one.  Yeah.  Oh, we did wear a Wolf movie so well back.  I know that we did all the thing on.  We did.  Oh, yeah.  You're pretty sure we did.  No.  You know, that's a Kevin Smith movie too.  If I ever saw a Wolf movie.  I said Kevin Smith movie.  That was his, uh,  That's what's the Kevin Smith movie too if I'm giving Smith movie.  That was his, uh, that was his, uh, path to getting into horror.  I do not know that.  I do not know that, but that's what I'm talking about in horror movies.  Keep talking to the chat if you want.  If you want to, if you want to talk to the back, throw them in the comments.  Let us know some other ones that we missed or movies that you think you  can sit about the horror because it's all subjective.  So don't be shy.  Let us know.  It's all in hips.  The only thing we didn't do is tonight we didn't show some new stuff. So I'll show I have to gather it all so I might I have to  You too had the same problem  Yeah, I don't know what it is because he started hitting some of the stores and  So I definitely got a lot of stuff. I'd bring some pictures. I'll bring them up. Well, yeah  Like I just I did ones that would just been easier with the pictures and then I'll show off whatever we got  that's a good one, Billy.  I definitely body horror.  I can see that.  Yes, indeed.  That movie was bizarre.  Fair.  I read the book.  I was on this kickboard, I was reading  like a lot of the Stephen King books  and the Richard Bachman books,  and I remember reading that book.  And I always wondered like how the hell  could they make this a movie?  And they did, because he wore that fat suit.  And the movie, the movie wasn't that great.  To me, the best part of it was,  call it. Cari were, she's hot as hell. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that was boarding on  horror too, but Bill, you're right. Red State's a good film. Like that, that's John Goodman.  The great John Goodman speaking of John Goodman. So, man, I did buy that blanket while you're  doing your stuff. You did buy it, huh? Yeah. Um, I'm guessing, because I didn't send you a picture  this. I'm guessing you did not buy this or did you take a chance to get this or no?  I was going to, but I was like, oh, I just need another one. Oh, because they didn't have my size.  I thought the Excel fit quite nicely for me, Pat. No, they didn't have an Excel. All they had was  they had large and below. They didn't have a, when I saw it, they didn't have an Excel in there.  I don't think they came in super fat. And I'm guessing this was the new one, right?  Yeah, that's the one I picked up.  Okay, I actually, I was kind of with you with all the blankets I didn't want to  get more, but that one's pretty cool.  I thought it was cool.  If you're still working, I'm just, uh, no, I'll bring it up on them.  It's, um, I found that little guy.  I know you got the little game.  I got cool guy.  Oh, and Pat, this is where it's really bad.  Are these from last year?  No, those are the resurrection ones.  No, Halloween two ones.  Oh, no, those are new.  Yeah, they had resurrection ones.  I have to pick up the Halloween two ones.  I don't think I had to actually let me bring this out for a second moment so we can see  Yeah, that's new they didn't have them when I was there because I look oh god of my good. Thank you  Nice  Yeah, it's usually sometimes I'll go off of the date 10 bucks. Yeah, I'll go off of the copyright  But they didn't have a copyright game on here. So  Okay, sorry. No, I'm sorry. I have to pick those up. I didn't see them  I know I leave found one spirit. So there's two I've been stalking so I'll probably ride by him tomorrow  See if they're open. I want to get those H2 lights  Yeah, I saw Frank got him  Yeah, he got him. I got I met the ask him which one because Frank doesn't live far you that's the back of that comic. Yeah  Did you get this or no?  No, I did not get this comic. Is this one of Frank was talking about?  It's a it was a San Diego Comic comic  did he talk about it on a stream and I didn't know that he did maybe?  Maybe it was probably a chrome cover?  Yeah. There's another picture of the front of him and it's a badass cover.  Yeah, this is the one he did a stream on Friday and just talking about it.  Oh, he did. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if it's still available or not.  That's where I left that back part of it so you can see.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, dude, this is a canvas from the artist.  His name and I left his card on the bottom there.  Tony, Santiago, I sat at this guy's booth  looking at all of his art.  And he had two canvases, or you can buy the print.  Some kid bought the canvas right in front of me.  So he had one left and I had to buy the canvas.  That's nice.  I like that.  Cool as hell.  Isn't it so fucking bad, I asked you.  That's 16 by 24.  That's nice.  We're, um, that's a movie we, well, you and I can bond over and I know neighbor Mike loves that movie. We're bringing a baseball guy. So  and the artist added you, correct. He died, which he told me all by. He's like, yeah, I didn't have money originally, but  I was like, I put him on there after the fact. I'm like, that's cool.  So  that's a I bought that canvas too because I love that shot on the bottom from the end of the first film. I think that's such a significant  camera angle from when they're getting Gary Bucie there. So  but yeah, these are canvases, Pat. That's nice.  That's I met Helen Hunt, very sweet lady. She signed it on the tornado there.  I talked to her briefly about some other films like, you know, what women want and as good  as it gets, I like as good as it gets.  I haven't, I wasn't a man about you, fan.  That might have been your area a little bit too, because you know, Paul Reiser was there.  And he was next to her, which was kind of funny.  Oh, what's that, but to show us that.  I mean, about you and that used to be all right.  Yeah.  And Paul Reiser is busy with that.  He was busy because it was a huge halo in the union there.  So yeah.  Yeah, good to beat her.  There it is.  Look at that.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  This guy falls in my top 10 celebrities have ever met.  Unbelievably cool guy.  Gave you all the time in the world and he had such a long line.  Now, thank you.  Not like he would like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he asked me.  Let me regard, of course.  So I do it to say.  but I wanted him to sign it in black and he's like dude this is awesome and red so  he's got a beautiful signature it makes cool yeah so I that's a movie we've  never watched together we should probably we should yeah I agree 100% love that  movie good cast and I was telling you about these from flashback where the guy  gave my brother bought like ten of them and he gave these two like duplicates  for free my brother gave them to me yeah because there was so many I got a look on  somewhere one of my drives somebody sent me all these to print out.  I got a lot of people.  But dude, my brother bought like, yeah, like it doesn't run for like 60 bucks.  And he gave me these.  He gave him these extra two, which he already had.  And the clings.  You want to buy it?  Okay.  The Hadn't Feel Tribune.  Oh, it was an Anthony Massey sent to go.  And he did that lost river driving thing.  He made an actual newspaper.  And I have a copy of it.  I feel unhappy.  Let me know.  I thought he didn't send you one.  Maybe he did.  But when he sent us framed ones.  Yeah, you probably did Pat. You're right. Wouldn't he send us the games the board games? Yeah  Well, yeah, we've talked about Spike Lee. This is one of the only few movies. I really enjoy that he did and he was actually cool dude to meet so  Yeah, and there's really sure looks like it's actually part of it. Yeah, it does right?  Jersey that movie with Edward Norton  I've never seen it  You know, it's about his time before he has to go to prison for a long time. Yeah, it's  So it's probably not the movie you can watch over and over again, but it's one of Spike Lee's better films  I think so  Interesting. Yeah, we keep on going up and there's all my sign to figure so  Yeah, oh, I said to the picture on the side of with Marty Kova. We talked about the  What's the last house on the left we talked about that for a bit? Mm-hmm. So  Look at all these bad-ish keychains, Pat.  The most old sold, is that like a custom made?  That's the name because they're cool as hell.  I like them.  Yeah, I didn't really have the great signal.  I was getting a message to you, but that person I got their business card.  So all those, that wasn't even 50 bucks.  Yeah, those are pretty cool. I like them.  So I've got their business card, Pat.  Cool.  And there's my parents' laser discs, of course.  Brenda Fraser beautiful signature. I know you're not a big signature guy, but  He sounds pretty damn nice. No, it is it's definitely cool  My my parents loved that movie up top. That's a kind of a  That's a sad movie in a way, but that's a very good movie. Not a lot of people talk about that movie. No, I remember the movie  But I don't think I've ever seen it a lot of people probably remember the Madonna song from the movie too  So and yeah, we added Paul Reiser to their Beverly Hills Copies and discover so  Oh, that's the US.  Oh, that's the scars.  Oh, there he is.  There you go.  He didn't bite me.  Hey, man, he's holding up well, though.  God bless him.  I got to tell you, Pat, this is what drives me crazy.  He had like 30 pictures on his table, right?  Only one from Rambo for his blood part two.  Only one.  And I'm like, God, only one from Rambo.  Because he was such a sleaze bag.  just sleaze bag. Remember how he left them there in a helicopter? Yeah. Oh, man. Nice guy though.  Very sweet guy. It's cool to be there. Oh, I said to that because he put this is not my  locker and said, this is not my office. That's right. Yeah, he's holding. But that's fine.  And it's a good story to talk about though. So he was pretty expensive for an autograph.  I mean, I'm gonna get that.  I did not get that, but it looks really nice.  That's, this is a terrifying flannel hoodie,  but no flannel hoodie that's that spirit stores looks awesome.  And this here, you sent me too.  Is this you walking into spirit?  Oh, then Burlington's right next door.  That's right.  That's, yeah, because I'm like, oh, look at this.  There's a Burlington.  And then there's, did you get anything in Burlington?  That picture.  the picture you're looking for. Oh, okay. Oh, you got the picture. I can't find that  fucking thing anywhere. It's some of a bitch. Oh, there's our buddies. So I bought Pat  one of those wobblers. They're at Menard stores in our neck of the woods. They're hard plastic.  That's funny. I'm surprised the dogs weren't going after them. Oh, they were locked up.  Cool stuff. Yeah. A lot of good stuff. Yeah, I think Pat for showing all that, but  see what's everybody saying here actually Kevin Smith's red state was also  bordering on horror the blab re makey as I mean yeah body my lihara scenes I  agree there og house with wax dr. Jacob is how I can be considered body horror  oh definitely especially actually both of them oh yeah because it gets I  don't know why it's so long such a good movie what Madonna song is in that I'll  remember. I'll remember, I'll remember you. One of these I forget what it is. And I can just  don't remember. He had one column from last time select just one black white photo. Did they  do they do look like penis character? Yeah, they do. Like we talk about that with the inflatables.  The inflatables too. Yeah. Now he didn't take a buy-out when he said it. He's like, no, he didn't bite  me. He did. He didn't bite me. He gave me a free picture. So he's trying to get back at a good  graces. Why are you guys are while you chat away? Let me go and get this  stuff right away. I should have brought it over here. Hold on one second.  As I hit the microphone hold on. Yeah, I got to start selling some stuff.  So yeah, Marty, cool real nice guy. There are some real good people there.  Like I really I have a you know, Kate Gillin from the Guardians of the Galaxy  Chris Nelson did her makeup. She was there and I have the picture of Chris Nelson doing her makeup.  And I totally forgot she was going to be there otherwise I would have brought that picture and  I would have been cool to talk to her about Chris Nelson too. But, well, Rob Schneider was there  like we're talking about. Who's the girl from the last Ghostbusters movie, The Young Girl? She's  She was there.  She had a ton of people there.  Jennifer Beals was there.  So everybody going flash dance crazy for her after life here.  There's some McKenna Grace's there name.  McKenna Grace, she was pretty busy.  You had the Reno 911 stars there.  Those two main characters.  They were walking around their uniforms.  Oh, God.  Michael Rooker, the whole National Impounds vacation, the original Griswold family.  all four of them were there in Randy Quaid. Chevy, Chevy canceled last year so they brought  he came back to make up for his cancellation last year so they seemed to have all done pretty well.  The big one there was John Cena, Holy cow. They must have made a ton of money at that  show for John Cena. Well, I just I wore on Tuesday, right? The button down. Yeah, I'm gonna have  I have to find that bad boy.  You can't find it.  Let me know.  I'll look.  Got that.  This was at the five below.  Sketchbook.  Yeah.  And it's got a cool back to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is cool.  I picked up a sketchbook.  I picked the other little mini bastard from spirit.  The baby.  The puppy.  Let's see.  And did you see these all at five  below to I haven't been to a five below recently so I haven't done a key chain  there along with the sketchbook they have the key chain H2 magnet they had  this there and another H2 lanyard as well I think I can't keep track of them  Your cheap is hell. I love that. I can buy below. It's it's five in below. So I think it's playing. That was nice. That's cheap stuff.  There he is.  God that music is ridiculous isn't it? It is. And while I was here, these came out last year  the two myos figures. They have different packaging now. And me being a geek, had a buy, I guess they have different packaging.  So you knew they're different packaging or did you just determine that I didn't know until I looked at him  I looked at him. I'm just to see if there was anything different and they're different packaging  And of course  Maggie met my  display  Yeah  Hold on here. I've just read and  Met go back in April and Pittsburgh and he made a video for my steps on for free Wow  Wow, love Maggie loves him.  She brought him cigar as a present.  He loved it.  That's cool.  Yeah, because he's always got a cigar with them, Colin.  We're having a home and drank.  We're gonna drop Schneider back in like 2011.  It was really.  I'm trying to think, Lane.  I was at when he first started going around doing  his stand up because that might have been the time  we saw him before our kids were born.  So they were always looking forward to the keyboard.  The keyboard?  Oh, so I think I've told you like my parents will live too far from a very heavy Indian reservation and they have like a big casino there and they always have big acts there. That's where I saw Huey loose in a news like 15 years ago.  But Rob Schneider was there at the police and I went to go see him and like we met him afterwards and really he's like, oh, you're from Chicago huh? It's like, yeah, it's like what are you doing up here? It's like, oh, my parents are retired. We'll be like, we'll tell you parents are said hi.  So random. It was cool.  Yeah, I went and so do we see years ago down my rarer that can meet you. Have you ever done my rarer?  Remember to see him and he hung out at the bar with us afterwards. He was funny as hell.  No kidding. Okay.  You got more stuff, Pat, where you just search it away.  Actually, you know, stuff I did forget to get out of the closet, but this is this is the big thing.  So I'm going to have to move the mic so I don't hit it.  Oh shit.  Oh, I called itchy. Itchy.  Pat, Newseer's itch.  Yes, one of those itchy and scratchy freaking doormats and  Shatter of Burlington. $7.00. Fucking cheap is hell.  That's why I got to all of them.  And I thought, I was, what do they?  Oh, I got this shirt at Walmart.  I don't buy the hoodie. You and I are going to work on shipping.  No, I could find the hoodie in my size.  So I'm not going to buy it anyway.  What the fuck else? I thought about something.  Oh, did Mike send stuff yet for the next tasting or something?  He was talking about, you know, he said,  I told him one night this week, we'll package everything up and shoot it out.  So maybe I should send you your stuff at the same time, you think?  Or maybe leave it at weekend?  Do you want anything leaving at weekend?  No, I'm unless I'm no, I'm probably not going back up North. I hope I don't know if anybody watching up North  I hope or not  I  Got too much going on. Are you drinking whiskey?  No, I was drinking this white wine. I got so much wine dude  We got I  Haven't had anything to drink since I took my mom out the dinner or no  Yeah, I didn't drink with you with the cigar the other night. It was when I took my mom out the dinner  I was like, I didn't even have a beer at the crowd.  I didn't even have a beer at the crowd.  I had two beers with Mike and the man came before I came over and then weighed too much  last night because like I said, we played this fan bank and they gave us a bunch of leftover  clams and shrimp.  So I called Mike on Mike what he doing.  He's like, I got steamers and I got bags of shrimp come over.  So we picked that last night and then kept breaking.  What a funny guy.  Did he go, did he have to go help with the move?  didn't he? I thought he did. No, because we got everything done here. And the wife felt bad.  She's, I don't make it dry for now. So he's got them care. So we managed to get everything done.  So I don't have to have to,  so he was able to stay home and have some shenanigans with me instead.  The shenanigans. So your mom, you're so Cathy just went then, right?  Yeah, she just went. She went and her roommates parents went. And then my wife stayed  you know, and the apartment with my daughter and who makes parents stayed in a hotel.  So they got everything set up and Kathy already on. Yeah, she got home like it's literally 20 minutes  before we started the stream. That's why I was a couple minutes late myself. She's tired of self  she was up late last night. She was up early dealing with my daughter arguing with the water as  usual. Oh, God, that's why I didn't that's why I didn't come back down after setting it up. I  I had to deal with that with the two upstairs.  Yeah, it never stops.  We started wrong before I get hit.  Yeah, never stops.  So yeah, that was my, so I had the nice plot.  Well, quite morning, the puppies have  looked me up super early to let them out.  Then went back to sleep.  So it was nice, waxing day.  Very nice.  It was a beautiful day where I get nothing in college.  And I can just relax.  Yeah, so that's everything tonight, man.  May we get the hell out of here.  I'm probably the ghost.  if the wife probably sleep and she's asleep,  I'm probably gonna go,  Mike's in the man cave,  we'll go hang on the man cave,  if not maybe I'm gonna be out in the garage.  Maybe I'll catch up on Davey Death,  right who's doing a stream right now.  Let's see what they're doing.  I will let you know in the off chance,  if I can do that here, but.  Yeah.  Do we have a certain time?  Oh yeah, so let's talk about that.  So next Saturday night.  It's a short night.  So why is that short?  I'm sure.  We're gonna do a watch along with Teen Wolf,  celebrate in 50 years of Teen Wolf.  Bill you're not working tomorrow? I'll hit you up.  Let a, what's a good time for you next Saturday? You got the young kid. So I'm good. My kids are out of the house.  Okay.  My son's gone. It's just me and the wife. The puppies again.  Our game is at 9 a.m. I am available at night. Anytime. I think we should start it right. That's  7 p.m. central. What do you think?  You want to do 7?  you're going to be eight p.m. central nine your time. Yeah, let's do a p.m. central nine.

So, don't set the hit the little notification bell.  It'll say, hey, it's good. It's already there. No, you come on.  It's okay. We're getting it done in under two hours, which is  Yeah, I'm gonna go get done and maybe hit a bill I will we'll cigar  Catch up on David. Davey's stream. Oh, no go to our favorite game show. David. That's right  The David death ratio the game show  He goes well who's on it is it the David that star guy  I said that the guy that liked weapons and didn't like weapons.  My hang out on Mike is a cracks me up sometimes.  Like I have music on, but every time I'm outside,  especially on a Saturday Sunday,  there's always music last night.  I always put the serious through my speakers outside the house.  And they'd be like, oh yeah, I know the song.  It'll be like, sweet, chocolate money.  He's like, is this like Motley crew?  And he's just like dead serious.  Or he just comes up with a, I'm like, what?  I'm like, what'd you live in a bottle?  What are you, boy, in the barn?  Oh, it's funny shit.  I thought he was kind of tires, he might have fell asleep.  I told, I said, if he's in the man cave, I see the man cave open and the TV's are  not stopped, but I feel like I'll be in the garage, so I'll probably hitch up, though.  Yeah, let's see if I can escape everybody and come out there.  Colin, of course, my brain is fried.  We talked about having you on again for a watch-on, for a fresh memory.  Why are we going to have Colin on for?  the  carl and refresh our memory one  yeah our memory  one  down  red doesn't remember either we were we were talking about having on for  moving I'm trying to remember what it was because I want to get it down on here  and we can plan it so before we sign off let me know yeah  yeah two is going to be a lot of fun make sure we come back make sure you hit the  like button for tonight if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button  We hit just hit 2,000 20, some members would be,  love to hit 3,000 by the end of the year.  I don't see it happen at the rate.  It would be nice though.  Well, we can try to make that happen.  Why not?  It'd be nice.  Yeah, maybe.  You know, I'll do another contest.  I did the contest years ago.  I'm gonna do another contest where I give something away.  I'll have to figure it out.  A Halloween prize package?  Yeah.  Maybe combine a whole bunch of stuff and just say, hey.  Yeah, well, team of's gonna be a lot of fun.  I haven't watched team of them so long.  It's gonna be fun.  You haven't watched it in so long.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Regular viewing.  I've even shown that movie to my kids.  That's right.  We were gonna have them on for George and I completely forgot.  We watched George and he's like,  oh yeah, we're gonna be nice if I was on it.  I'm like, fuck, I forgot about that guy.  But then I straight back when you went for something that  didn't I see want to come on first another movie?  I thought there was.  Well, why don't we make it a, why don't we watch full cheese zombie or something?  Maybe we can do because I know he's a big fan of that.  Yeah, we can do that.  We can do that.  We want to do a Tuesday night watch along with zombie.  And next, like within the next month.  Yeah, let me know.  We'll talk afterwards and hit me up and let me know how to how to tonight's workout with  the new job you're starting because if it doesn't work out, we can do it a different  night.  Speaking of that Pat, that's a good point.  I might be assistant coaching for softball here.  I'm gonna know on this upcoming Tuesday.  So if I have watched, we do watch along  and I probably wouldn't make it back until like 7.30,  but Wednesday's I'm open and Monday's I'm open.  So and Thursday, so I'm just saying  if it's gonna make it easier to possibly change it one day.  Well, let's just, let me just see what's gonna happen  on Tuesday.  If you move the two, choose that if you move the Wednesday nights, that works.  I'm okay on Wednesday nights.  I think we originally did too.  I've seen why we did Sundays and do Sundays are easier to do a podcast.  But I know you helped me out when Taylor was doing softball last fall.  We did stuff on Wednesdays for a little bit.  But yeah, we can move them to.  Yeah, that's fine.  Well, let's yeah.  Okay, good.  Good colony.  So it's maybe a week from Tuesday, week from Tuesday, week from Tuesday, we can do zombie.  And we'll have fell in our.  Yeah, and then next week or this upcoming week, we should make it up with what resurrection and  From return to living dead is that what we're talking about  We're talking about living dead is on Tuesday  We're gonna do teen wolf on Saturday  But we could squeeze resurrection in one night. I'll do that  I think maybe we should try to do this since we did a poll I guess  Guys I made an executive decision when I realized it was the 40th of return of living dead, but um  I know I said something to Pat the other night. I'm like, hey, I just realized that this is turning 40 and it wasn't on the list like it told you, Pat, because I think we've done, I think we've actually done two. We did one with Michael and then we did one with just us.  Yeah.  Anyways.  Yeah, and this will be a moment we won't have it as a watch long again for quite some time because they're only going to do it again because it's very significant milestone that it turns 40.  Yeah, so we definitely will hit you up and we'll set it all up now.  Yeah, but I'm fine.  Have you had been there on an awhile because they see it?  the  this week here.

I mean, you know, yeah, granted, you know, I only got her last  Friday.  Right.  So.  But yeah, she's not right, though.  But have you looked on,  well, we talked the last night.  I got to look and I went ahead and looked up the,  there's a map called Wag.  And you know, there may be somebody who is a dog walker  in the, in your area.  Well, close by, I mean, my big 10, 15 miles away  and I may be willing to drive a little bit of waste.  Yeah.  So I might look, I just,  It's just yeah, the last few days it I've been feeling like I used to feel before I stopped working  Right, man. I mean I seriously last couple days. I've been I've almost been wanting to cry I've been hurting that bad  You know, it just because it's like fuck  You know, I mean I still I still take around. I don't you know, I don't shirt from that, but right, you know  But yeah, it just  I don't know. I'm trying. I'm going to have to wind up and go back to ortho and maybe physical therapy.  Yeah, see, they can figure out what's what that stat and did to you. Yeah, because it's  because I mean, you know, I've, you know, I've told them I hurt and all like that and they don't  say that I'm not lying, but it's like they're just I just I just kind of feel like they're  pacifying me. Yeah. As I know, motherfucker, if you don't get it, trade me.  Try. Please. Just one day of, you know, doing this and, and, and just feel it for one day.  That's all I'm asking. Yeah. I mean, shit, when my backyard's bad enough to wear,  I have a hard time breathing. It sums up. Yeah. Now there's, there's something there.  for sure. And it kind of makes me mad because, you know, I want to go out and make videos and  shit like this, but I'm trying to get my routine down with, with, you know, bellowing stuff like this,  and it's kind of get through this. Paying this just like, you know, make it. I mean, I will figure it  out. I'm not saying alone. I will figure it out. I believe it. So, you know, I mean, you  know, I won't keep it. I have a fine feeling that you would. Yeah. And I mean, I mean, I mean,  she is a sweet dog. Now, we'll say, I'm not sure if I'm not sure. See, she likes cats or  not. Right. I can tell you for a fact, do not let her see a cat in her yard.  As it was funny the other day we was out walking and we walked around the house, right?  And apparently, well, there's a black, straight cat. You know, I've seen it couple times.  I mean, Cat never messaged with anything.  So, you know, I don't worry about it too much.  Well, this cat was under the house.  And she, I guess, spoke to the whatnot.  And it bolted out from under the house and oh my God.  I'm glad I was prepared because when she got to the end  of that leash, I just held firm.  And yeah, he really wanted that cat.  It's a good hunting season.  Yeah.  That's, yeah.  Then more than likely it's not a good thing  to have a cat around her.  Well, you see, that's the thing.  I don't know because I don't know how many cats  she's been around and see what was funny.  Out in my backlight and dude saw, what's up, dude?  I've got a flat piece of concrete and that cat likes to hang out there and when we were  inside, oh my god, she spit most of the day at the back door watching that cat.  She's like, motherfucker, you.  And then, you know, few hours later, that cat moved up closer.  We said by the tree, so I went and got a leash.  I said, come on.  And so we walked outside.  And I mean, I knew exactly what was going to happen.  I mean, you know what's going to happen.  Yeah.  And she bolts and launches into that leash.  And I'm hanging on.  And that cat takes off.  Haven't seen that cat since.  Ha ha ha.  Well, cats gone, don't you?  You used to be crying here.  You used to be off, friendly for the early time.  I got one of the other things around.  Right.  Oh, and now anytime we walk around the house,  she's sniffing under the house.  I mean, if I let her go,  she would crawl under the house and check.  Right.  I'm sure she wouldn't fucking try to kill that cat.  The thing is, the cat's not there, but by God,  he still thinks it's there.  Well, the sense there, yeah.  You know, it's just fun hearing anything.  I'm like, no, come on, girl, come on.  You know, and then she'll, okay, fine.  And then she'll walk a little bit,  and then she'll try and nose back up under the house.  I'm like, ah, nope, come on.  Oh yeah, it's funny.  But yeah, no, it's, yeah, I don't know exactly  what she'd do around the cat, but,  I don't know if I'm gonna find out.  Yeah, I guarantee you she will fucking slap that cat about the head and neck region a bit.  Yeah, you know, she might, but say I don't know.  I mean, I mean, she is curious about cats because I've got that stuffed animal.  And so yeah, okay.  The first stage, oh my god, her attention was on that thing. She's like, move.  move. I'm on move. And it went moving and she knows it. And it went move and then finally  she's like, okay, it's thing. I'm leaving. And yeah, that's no fun. I don't want to.  And hasn't and hasn't messed with it since? Nope. Nope. Nope. But I do know she does  not like the vacuum cleaner. Most dogs don't. Yeah. Yeah. Now I pulled it out today because  I mean, it had been a while since I had swept or anything. And the house was looking kind  of rough. So it's like, yeah, I needed to do that. And so yeah, I pulled it out. And I mean,  And he didn't go nuts, but she made it to her to stay away from it.  Did she try to bite it at first?  No.  Nope.  Nope.  Well, I'm just an unfamiliar sound.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just what it was.  She's like, I don't like that sound.  You're like, nah, and then I switched it off and I had to move the cord, so I left  it where it's hit.  And it was in living room.  I was going to wear.  She was hanging out at, right?  Well, she come walking by the vacuum and brushed up against it and it bolted.  Yeah, that was going to be me.  I'll jump.  So and then I moved the cord and then I wound up in my bedroom and I sweep it in my bedroom  and she had come walking in and was on the far side of the bed and I flipped the vacuum on.  Yeah, boom, she's gone.  She's like, yeah, no.  And then I said, I'm done.  And then she walked to the house to make sure that it wasn't around.  Right.  So, yeah, it's been kind of funny.  That's why it's for me.  Yeah.  Dogs are very interesting.  especially when they're racist.  What's that?  Especially when they are racist.  Oh, when they're racist?  Yeah, my golden retriever.  Oh, yeah, you talk about racist.  Oh, hell.  You, black person come by?  She was showing, I mean, we had two kids,  one of them don't post housing,  had my yard fence down,  and then the next housing,  because I was in an eight plex,  the next eight plex. You know, had their fencing. So there was about probably 40 feet in between  the fences that was just common, just common area. So these two black kids were walking in that  common area. My dog hid behind the fucking big tree that we had in our backyard hid behind it  and tell those boys got close enough to that fence. She bolted out from around that tree showing  teeth scared the living shit out of those two kids. Oh my God. Oh, yeah. If you're black,  she was show teeth. My next door neighbor was a black family. His name was that nail.  And if he was out in his backyard, oh, yeah, Augie would fucking go nuts until  until Nell got the hose because this dog, if there was any water around, she was in it.  So he got the hose out and was like, you know, playing with her with the water.  Jim had problem one with that when he shut off the water.  He was black.  He had a problem.  So he he's spraying the water, letting her chop at the water type thing and then just spraying  on her because yeah, she just loves water.  And then we call her in.  She's so fucking wet.  And I look outside and this fucking blue sky.  I'm like, what the fuck?  How the fuck is this dog wet and the ground isn't?  What the fuck?  And then about five minutes later, Nell comes knocking at my front door and I'll  He's in the house now.  Oh, see's now.  Oh, yeah.  She about went through that glass door after him.  And so we got all of you back in the living room.  And I went outside.  He's like, oh, by the way, all of you was outside.  And he, you know, you know, he doesn't like black folk.  And we black folk.  And so I just hosed her down.  She loved that until the hose went off.  Oh, yeah.  So he's frayed her with water.  And about five minutes later he comes and explains.  It's like, okay, not a problem.  I'm like, Jesus, dog, you're fucking just, wow.  As long as a black person is, I lose with water.  You find.  It's a, if they don't have, yeah.  If they don't have a hose, oh yeah, you're gonna get bit.  Oh yeah.  Well, I gotta say, I gotta say, everyone that,  I'd say a bell has been around.  She loves everybody because I went and saw my neighbor Ray.  I mean, he didn't get too close to her and nothing, but she was on the leash and didn't  try and bark or nothing.  And my neighbor crossed the street.  Johnny, he comes over and oh yeah, oh yeah, Billy just loves her.  And then when I took it to the vet, I found out that Bill of the Life was in the  like she's with us.  Because the vet walked in and I mean, I mean, the vet's cool, but he's a little weird.  He was he walked in and him toe shoes and those things, those things look kind of weird  anyway.  But I mean, he was cool.  Nice guy.  And yeah, yeah, freaking brother walked up to each of them.  of the assistant him and yeah, they were just patting her and all like that shit, bellows  eating all that up.  Okay, I'm good.  And then found a cheese with his, oh my God.  So yeah, Auggie was Auggie didn't get cheese with, but I tell you what sliced trees and  block cheese.  If you had it, Auggie was dead up in your face.  Really?  Where's mine?  Where's my cheese?  There's my fucking cheese at.  You're eating cheese, why am I not eating cheese?  Right, right.  Oh yeah, that dog was addicted to cheese.  But cheese was a little bit too expensive,  so the dog never got cheese with.  Right.  Yeah, no, it is.  I mean, I don't know.  I'm just trying things slowly because, you know, I mean,  she's a year old.  I mean, I don't think she's been trying at all.  Like honestly, for being a year old and being as trained  and as calm as he is for the most part,  it's crazy, man.  It's crazy.  I wonder the situation with the family that had Bella  before you didn't for whatever reason have to give her up  if they moved or moved into an apartment that didn't allow  ads or you know, whatever. And they basically had to give her up or do you know the story?  All I know is that all I know is that Bella was a stray Bella was.  Yeah. Yes, Bella was a stray. And they, uh, they put her birthday as about August 1st of last year.  You know, it's an approximation. But so, so, so with think about it, the first eight weeks,  So the first two months of an animal's life,  they're just puppy puppies.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, they're just learning everything.  And then, you know, I don't know if Bella ever had a home,  but if she didn't, the next 10 months,  she was roaming the streets, I guess,  is the only thing I can figure out  and how she's so mild mannered is beyond me.  I mean, it's great. I'm not complaining, but no means.  But it's just, it's weird.  Right. And to be housebroken and, you know, that kind of stuff.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, she's had about four accidents in the house since I've had her.  You know, it was, which, you know, I expected, you know, a few accidents.  I mean, that was wild, I guess.  And then in a kennel for two months.  So, you know, it's like, okay, you know,  I mean, I didn't get upset at her because,  you know, she's still learning everything.  But as far as, and I normally take her out  every couple hours, you know,  two three hours, whatever, just to walk around.  and everything like that, just to, you know,  get her on a kind of a routine.  Right. And everything.  And I try and like it like eight nine o'clock at night,  I don't give her any more water till the morning.  Is right.  You, he will have an accident.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  So I just, I just hold off and then in the morning,  You know, we, we, we start process again.  So well, and I'm sure here probably shortly, if I was a  Batman, she'll give you some type of sign that she needs to go  out, like a nose nudge on your hand or a bar or, you know,  something like that, you two will get a pattern developed.  right. Yeah. And she's, she's the someone that started that is, uh, I mean, not now on a regular  basis, but like, you know, she tries to, you know, put her front paws in my lap and then  nozzle me and stuff like that and get excited. It's like, yeah, I probably ought to take you out.  You know, yeah, that's it. So, yeah, and see what's  cool. Well, it's weird too. Okay, put her leash on her, take her out. And then when we get  back on the porch, I take the leash off of her and she stays right there. And if I sit  outside, just smoke a cigarette, I don't even put her on her leash. That's cool. Yeah. And  I mean, that's it's crazy.  And she does not leave and does not leave the porch.  No. Nope.  Does not leave the porch.  You know, I've ventured to guess there will be one time that she leads that porch.  If she sees a school, if she sees a squirrel.  No, you know, honestly, because Mark's have.  Now, yes, maybe.  Okay, but the squirrels, the squirrels still playing the trees.  You know, all around her.  And she'll listen, look up in the trees and see them play in her.  You know, trust my yard.  I got a tree.  This girl's love to run up and down in.  Uh-huh.  The yard right there?  He don't.  She didn't pay him no mind.  Wow.  Right.  That.  I don't think you got.  I don't think you adopted a dog.  Rich.  Really.  No.  Which, really, I really don't.  I think you adopted an alien.  Because Augie, that was another thing.  Squirrel, oh my God.  Yeah.  He saw a squirrel.  It was game on.  Right.  And he would chase that in because we were let him out in the front yard and we didn't  have a very big front yard.  It was a commentary yard.  But you had to mow your piece up to a certain point.  All the front yard bit was just basically common area.  And if she was out front and a squirrel went by, oh hell, he would chase that squirrel  wherever that squirrel led until it got to a tree.  I didn't have any trees in the front area.  I had, we had trees off to the very side.  And that was about probably a hundred feet.  So he would chase that squirrel all the way over to the trees.  And then when he couldn't see the squirrel anymore,  it's like, okay, come back home.  Oh yeah, but he was a big squirrel.  Squirrel loving, hating, chasing, fool.  And that's crazy.  Yeah, Bella's not like that.  this is great. It's awesome, but it's weird at the same time.  You know?  Yeah, I expect her to go crazy and please do some stuff.  Good chance, Abbot is that she's...  She learned early on that, yeah, you have to mind what the humans are about.  Yeah. And you know, and she's also still learning the new atmosphere. Right. And taking it all in,  I'm sure. Because she's never had humans. You know, she's like just, and now she has a forever  human. Yeah. You you definitely got blessed. I believe so. I honestly do because just in these  last six days, seven days, whatever. I mean, yeah, I mean, it hasn't really been that hard.  Like I said last night, the hardest thing is dealing with me, you know, because I can't walk  they're faster than nothing. And she will learn your idiosyncrasies and know the days that you  feel good and the days that you don't feel good. She'll eventually be able to sense that.  that  five  yeah, yeah, I don't know that that I don't I don't know that at all  You know, yeah, but when it comes for walks. She's like man, if I can all man  It's feeling good big dammit  I guess I don't really can't get to go for a walk  No, I still take her out walker is just  you know how you feel in the pendant on how many miles you get to go miles and  no it's not miles dude it's I you know will we'll walk to the back part of my  yard you know and walk around a little bit and walk back out you know and  normally by the time we get back up by the Jeep yeah it's yes he's at the end  to the leaf, stopping and waiting on me. And then when we get up to the steps, village  just walks up the steps and then just stops and then waits on me to get up. So, and she  just stands there. So, that's there. She knows. She knows. Yeah. And so yeah, I mean, I'm  I'm happy. I'll say that.  Yeah. Yeah. She's learning you just like the way they treat our trained dogs to sense seizures.  They'll know it's coming on before you do. Right.  So yeah, she's already starting to know that, okay.  You know, this is his, you know, limitations.  But I know she's fucking just over the moon, over the moon,  that she has a dedicated human.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yeah, it's funny when she wants to play.  She lays flat on the floor and kind of  pounds or pause on the floor and wagging our tail and stuff. So I know Bella's wanting to play.  And so I'll play with her, you know, back and forth, you know, very leg-laying stuff like that.  And then I'll grab her cow. I got her and he's starting to play with that too. So  I bet she would have fun with the tug rope.  I got one.  She's still not used to it yet.  So is it a rope with two knots at the end?  Or the four knots all together, but yeah.  Okay.  Because they also have those rubber ones that have, they basically look like two handles.  Right.  Now, I also just went just as a knot at the each end and then two more in the middle and the ends are losing Friday.  Right. Yeah.  Yes.  You're still not really hip on that one or and I got her a couple tennis balls and she's not up on that.  So.  Well, you ought to take her to what's that big pet store chain.  pest smart. Oh there's pet smart, there's pet cow, there's quite a few um you know take her in there  and let her choose. Right yeah I I haven't taken her to a pet cow yet. I bet you if you got her  one of those octa places she'd probably play with that. Yes you might. And years and years of  for a tug toy. Right. Of course, the first time she picks it up and starts flailing her  head and one of those arms comes back around and smacks her in the back. She's gonna be like,  oh, fuck this shit. I ain't playing with this phone based no more. Right. Well, as  most of it trying to beat me up. So yeah, I mean, I'm good. I'm good. No, go ahead, dude.  Well, I was going to say if you take her there and take that perfect something out.  You know, it could be that that's what she'll play with the most.  That could be that could be. I think you got a very intelligent companion.  Yeah.  I found a way to you on that one.  Yeah, of course. Brian's companions.  No, there he is.  And not so much.  They're there there.  Yeah.  Would you call fine?  Yeah, there it is.  Maybe it wasn't the front have it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not.  I never expected any of either one of them to save my life and  And the dire need.  Well, you never know.  They may just fucking surprise you.  And again, they just may be at it.  Yeah, they just I'm not going to hold my breath.  I will over-block it that way.  Well, you know what happens when say you fall down and you know,  you're standing next to your best friend or word to the three of us are together  and you fall down.  down, you know, the first thing is going to happen, right?  Or actually the first three things that are going to happen.  If you fall, first thing is going to happen is we're just going to stand there and  we'll have to catch it.  That try to maybe try to help you up better, go to P on me.  No.  No, that's number four.  That's number four.  Number two is we start taking pictures.  And number three is we start taking videos so you can hear us laughing in the background and  Then maybe fourth we'll come over there and help you out. Oh, okay. Well, whoo  Basically you get over there start helping me out. So hey, look at it this way. It's in the top five  There you go  in the top five at least  But who these days when somebody gets hurt fucking whole crowd around him is just fucking laughing at him  And nobody's gonna help.  There's so fucking laughing at him.  That, wow, it's expected to have a couple of,  couple giggles about it.  Right.  It's funny.  Pictures and videos work well too.  That's right, because what is the saying today?  No pictures, no proof.  That's right.  We're gonna damn sure have pictures and videos  so we can go back and prove it.  got pictures. It didn't happen. That's right. It did not happen. You know, so basically the first  five thousand years, nothing happened in the last five thousand years until the middle of the  18th century when they finally got the development of the film. Right. And print out well.  So that's right. It proved the history happened anything before that. I guess it never happened.  Well, a lot of people seem to think that now. I mean, no, ain't that fucking cruise?  It didn't happen like that. Yeah, it did.  Where's the cruise?  Yeah, motherfucker pick up a book and read it.  Right. Oh, if it's all in the internet, it's gotta be fucking true.  Yeah, okay. Look at all the fucking AI companions I got out there now.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was.  I'm sorry for the day and kids that are going off and thinking that AI is the best, uh,  best thing to happen to them. Yeah, for them to actually have say a mail and, you know,  talking to a female and someone like that. And it's like, you're just talking to a fucking  computer. Yep. But they fucking, that's reality to them. Well, I wouldn't say that I take  it that far, but I do it. I don't do it all the time. You know, I don't, I don't, I don't  ask it to, you know, make free. Yeah, free. Yeah. Yeah. We kind of get the point on that  one, but still. Okay, you know the difference between reality and AI. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Definitely.  Yeah. Some of those people don't. Some of the newer generation don't. Well, no, that's true. Because you see,  that's the thing. No one's taught him. And yeah, because people, people on their own really don't  don't carry to do their own research.  Probably rather, and this is why we have this problem of a lot of people thinking of if it's  only internet is true and no one's not because there's a lot of misinformation out there.  You actually view many different pieces and put the pieces together and a lot of people  just don't know how to do that.  Not that hard really. Right. I mean, I can do it. I can. Yeah. Yeah. And because you're  going to educate yourself. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And that's, you know, that's  the thing. Just, you know, if you don't know something, look it up and then if you don't  believe it. Okay. Look at another piece. Exactly. Look at, you know, a couple of different  viewpoints and figure out where you fall in middle. That's just what I do. And see, yeah,  I still get it wrong. Are you going to lie? Well, until any one of us is able to walk  on water with the water being, I'll say 78 degrees. Yeah. And you go,  fucking half. Right. You know, they know they ever gonna be  perfect. No, no, never will. But you know what? That's okay,  because that's what makes us human. Yeah. Well, yeah. So yeah,  it's that's, uh, yeah, I mean, I know I'll get stuff from I  just trying to just trying to limit it.  Yeah. That's the word I was going to say.  However, we, but it is a true fact.  If I tell you two plus two is going to be four, I'm sure you're not going to question.  No. No. Now if I tell you the last four digits of pi is 4176, you might want to question it.  I'm probably going to question that one because as far as I know pi runs out to infinity.  Yeah, I was going to say they haven't ever been able to find the end of pi.  You know?  Yeah.  But I mean, I'd look just to see just in case, you know, someone did come to the end because that would be like freaking awesome.  Oh yeah.  I'm sure that there is a computer out there right now  that has been doing that calculation for,  it's fucking the last 40 years.  Oh, I went down to it.  Just to see if there's an end.  Which we know is never gonna happen, so.  Or so, we'd say.  But I bet you, when we get up in the heaven,  God's going to say, okay, it was 1 9 7 2.  There's your fucking integer.  Right, right.  Eventually it will run out.  Well, then you're going to go damn.  I wish I knew that sooner.  We'll see the thing as I just asked Jim and I, right?  I just typed it in.  And it says no, no one has ever found the end to pie.  I is an irrational number, which means it  can't be expressed as a simple fraction and its decimal representation goes on forever without  repeating. It's not just that they haven't found the end yet. It's a fundamental property  of the number that it has no end. But they've calculated it out to trillions of digits  and they still haven't found out.  I know what.  So, I mean, yeah, you're right.  They're still trying.  And computer zies with days, the way it can fucking  calculate how many thoughts does it have per second,  tens of thousands?  Oh, yeah, easily.  Of calculations per second.  Yeah, yeah, that it depends on the processor speed,  know that. I mean, it's still, I mean, I mean, even the oldest slowest computer can still  can still compute faster than weekend. Yes. You can take an old Apple SE with, you know,  64 megabytes of RAM and it can still add subtract multiplying the by faster than weekend.  Yeah. Oh yeah. You know, or the Apple II or, you know, IBM's computers. In fact, I was  watching, uh, when it was modern, modern marvels or how it's made something like that the other day.  And on a commercial breaks, they had like little trivia thing, right?  Yeah. And the first, the first commercial computer was built in 1951. It was called the  univac one. It weighed 16,000 pounds. And that was all it said. I was just like, man, that's crazy.  Yeah. Like the first computers with NASA's, the fucking whole day on the room was a computer.  because they needed a whole fucking room.  Well, I mean, I mean, they didn't have the small, you know, a surface mount technology  that they have now today.  Well, yeah, now they're getting chips in the fucking nanoseccer sector.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, looked at the galaxies as the Z-fold seven, the newest one out.  And that things I found in a tablet built into one.  Right.  Yeah.  Because it flits twice.  Is that the one that you're talking about?  The way.  It's a small square.  Then you can flip it to the size of say a regular smartphone.  And then you open up again and it's damn near the size of a tablet.  Now this one here is closed.  It's, it's, it's, it's about the size of my phone a little bigger. It's thinner by far.  It's like half the size of my phone, thickness wise. And then you just flip it open.  And it opens into an eight inch tablet.  Oh, okay. Yeah.  But if you have a close, there's still a phone face that you can use. Yes.  That's right. Yeah. Okay. That's what it was. Yeah.  that's what it worked. That's a Z Fold 7. Now, there's a Z Fold flip that, yeah, you can  fold it in half and then when you open it up, it just, you know, it's like a regular  phone, then. Yeah. For our friend of mine, one of the guys I worked with had one of those  said he fucking, he bought her in about three months later. He fucking got rid of it. He  said he just said, I want that at all.  Yeah, that's a bad thought.  Well, doesn't seem annoying.  Was that the flip?  The folding pounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, they've gotten a lot better since they first come out.  But yeah, I think it's, it's just weird, you know, and plus what the Z Fold 7.  Now the six has it, but the seven, they don't have the pen support.  You know the little stylus?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, okay.  And that just actually bugs me.  Kind of bugs me because, you know, I mean, I don't use my pen a lot, but I call my tablet.  I do use my pen.  Well, okay.  Okay, but if you use your pen so much on the tablet, why don't you do it on the phone?  Why do I do because this phone I have does have a  F-pin  Support and has a pen with it and I do use it. I don't use it a lot, but I do use it  You know, it's you know, especially if I'm trying to edit a video or what not on my phone  but uh, yeah  It but you see with that  that, Ms Z-fold, there's no pin support at all.  Now, there are workarounds, but I mean,  that phone there, I think from Verizon,  you're looking at $2,200.  Yeah, no.  Right?  You know what, I'll do the same thing  like I do with the movies.  I'll wait till they come on fucking TV.  I'll wait, I'll wait on that phone and tell it, well, if you subscribe to 12 months, we'll  give it to you for free.  Right?  That's what I'll get it.  And of course, at that point in time, it's so far behind the times, it's like that phone  comparing it to the razor.  Right?  Or that, or that slide keyboard.  just floons that that was a small phone, but you, you, you  have slitted open had a keyboard. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I didn't  like them too well. You know, and I got one of those and it was  brick with strictly a PD it was a PDA personal whatever  lights. Yeah, yeah, personal data system. There you go. You  know, and the senior command got given those, right?  What? Mine went into my desk and it stayed in my desk. I'm like, if I can't use it as a phone,  what the fuck goes it for me?  Right. Yeah.  Well, they was they was wanting you to schedule your day out on your calendar.  right. When's the last time in the military, you scheduled your day out and it looked anything  like what you had thought that you were going to do. Oh, never. I don't never. Not in the  army, man. Not in the army. I don't care. How will you backward plane your day? It was  fuck the synergy you as cine dry is opened. Yeah. I mean, that's just exactly what it was.  You know, I guess what? It went backwards from there. Right.  So it's like, it's like why even try and play in, let's just go with the flow, man.  Yeah, let's have a meeting in preparation of the meeting.  So we can schedule ourselves another meeting.  Yeah.  Then they wind up having a meeting and then having the pre meeting and then having the other  pre meeting.  Yeah.  And then of course you have to have an after action review session of the meeting and what  was ever resolved?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  about right. Yeah, I didn't I didn't have have too many of those. I got to go on the floor  and work more but there was a few times I had to jump in and play big keys and I didn't know  first. Oh fuck I hated it. My bet you did. But yeah, I do not know that one bit. Well,  But, but man, I had to do a job and I got selected for it.  So, you got a violent toad.  Not oh, every bit of fucking volunteer.  I always hated that.  I always hated getting violent toad.  And that's the thing, I could be standing in formation.  Minor my own business.  Now, you can't get attention.  I'm not platooning, starting to look at me as they tell us.  Fuck. I was like, what? I didn't do nothing, Sarge.  hard.  Yeah, but you're going to.  Now, oh, like, yeah, you are.  It's like, I don't know, man.  That's because you weren't paying attention.  Right.  That's the ending.  You know, I'm sitting there thinking because I was on the third row back.  And we'd normally line up by rate rank.  So at the time I was knee four.  So I was right next to my platoon or my squad leader.  Yeah.  He was a, well, he was a corporal because he was, he was E4P for so long and waiting on the  points to drop.  So, so, so he could go to P.O.D.C. which is now the warrior course or something.  I don't know.  Anyway, they had to make him a hard strike because he was, he had been E4P for like,  Oh, God, three, four months.  And they're like, look, we've got to do something.  You know?  And I don't, I don't,  I think the point's finally did drop  for him to go to PLC and he made us five,  or you know, probably about another month or two after that.  Why I made us five?  And it was funny, I'd give him shit.  It's like, man, man, I have to call you a Sarge now.  He said, no, he's a shit.  I love his, because his last time was, was popling.  P O P L I N. Poplin cool guy, just fucking cool guy.  I never did go on the search after that.  I just called him.  That's where he fucked up.  No, I'm curious.  That that is where when we had that happen, you know, somebody go from  45 they would either change teams or they would change batteries.  Oh really?  Yeah.  So that there was no so that that individual could actually be an NCO and not a buddy.  Yeah.  Well, let's say we were on the canning.  So I mean, we were we were attached to Charlie County. I 120 for a signal battalion.  And we were in we were in headquarters, but you know, because that's where all the  all the mechanics and everything. We were headquarters platoon. Yeah. And so so when he made his five,  there was really no place to moving. You know, so and  I mean, honestly, he didn't really want to be moved, but yeah, I understand what you're saying,  because, you know, you know, I mean, like I said, the dude, dude was a good squad leader.  He was real nice.  He would, he would, he would still jump.  Yes.  If, if you got, you know, messed up.  But, you know, it was, it was never that bad.  So did.  He still had to earn his respect as an NCO or did he have it because he was a corporal.  He had it because of the rank and his position being an all guard.  Being a squad leader for so long, I mean, basically the five was purely clerical because  everyone knowing, you know, he was a squad leader. And we all knew that, you know, what  he said when?  Okay. So you, you already had or he already had your respect of the position when he  given being saying he for, if he told somebody out another he for, it's like you need  to get this done. There was no question. Yeah. Yeah. None at all. That's it. I mean, yeah,  So, yeah, him, him making his five, like I said, he was, it was more for paperwork because  we knew he was in charge.  So at least you guys had the mutual respect, you know.  Yeah.  And that's why, that's why I liked him, you know, because he was a leader.  He actually one led by example, explained things and if he didn't know the answer, he didn't  bullshit you'd say, well, I'll find out and I'll tell you.  And he would, you know exactly.  You know, and or sometimes you know, he would ask me, do something.  I'm like, come on, man, really?  But you know, I'd still go do it anyway just because it was a nice guy.  And you know, he was a must-squad leader.  It's like, I, you know, I won't argue with you too much.  But there still wasn't the tree separation.  But again, like you said, you didn't have the opportunity just because of the fucking overall structure of the unit.  right right yeah I mean yeah there was and I'm saying unless they they moved  him to a totally different unit which you know they could have done but then  that there would have made me a squad leader because I was next in line how do  you think you would have done at that time probably not so well to be honest  Well, yeah, you're right.  Because I mean, I was what?  19 years old, I was a hothead.  You know, yeah, I was...  I didn't know how to act, really, to be honest with you.  I was an ass.  So yeah, I probably wouldn't have done very well.  But you would have learned to...  You would have learned to adapt and to...  It becomes that NCO versus, you know, just being an NCO in a total asshole, which I  know quite a few of them.  But yeah, no, you're right.  Well, I was one of them.  However, you know, you guys know me.  There's not much fucking gray.  It's the black bird's wife.  Right?  I wasn't a military. It's either black or it's white. There is not too many fucking shades gray here. Maybe two  three max, but  No, I was  When I met business you could you could fucking tell it in the tone of my voice and my my facial gestures of  That I have no doubt dude  I know you I have no doubt  But in turn, I could also talk to them on an equal level.  Right.  The Darryl and then bullshit.  You know, and just be one of the guys.  But of course, they also knew that, you know, when it was that not that time to be just one of the guys.  Right. Right.  Yeah, and this that's the biggest thing is trying to stay human and and and still be a leader especially  When you work so closely with  You know your group  Sometimes it's hard, you know because you know people see you one way isn't it and and then they see you another way and it's it's  you know hard thing for  you know some people to say a distinguished  But yeah, just differentiate. Yeah. Yeah. You go see there. Yeah  $12 worth per today  That's a $12 worth per day  Different you  But no, that's I mean that's true  That's the biggest thing  You know with the military  Yeah, man when I was the rear-deep and  and I got that oh set battery of 33 34 brand new privates within two fucking days of each other all come into the same unit  oh my god  oh yeah that and two days before my main brigade main body started to deploy  yeah I was a busy motherfucker  I bet you. And our, our battalion rear was assigned to be the guard for the backdrop area.  Which is fine. You know, every, every rear D had their assignments of getting the brigade out.  Ours happened to be, you know, guarding the backdrop area. So how many senior NCOs do you think the rear detachment had?  Oh, not me. Senior in sales.  Senior in sales.  Me. One.  One.  Guess you had to be.  No, one.  Me.  I had two e-part.  No, I had for the rear command staff.  I had one e-five and one corporal.  Oh, my God.  And me and the commander.  We're on up for people.  So guess you got to be at every fucking bag drop.  That's crazy.  24 bag drops in 58 hours.  I could call him preach say that was one of my longest days  I've ever had in the military was that  because I had to be at every fucking bag drop.  Right.  When I got to argue with the captain too,  that was a lot of fucking fun.  I was bad.  And so I don't remember which cycle the bag drops  was but this captain wanted to drop his bags beforehand as the other bag drop ended. He was  trying to drop his bags at that point in time. I'm like, sir, you can't do. There ain't going to  be nobody here to protect your bags. So I'm going to drop my bags. I'm like, you know, a service.  As soon as you drop those bags and you leave, yes, we will pick up your bags and then I'm  going to walk them right into the brigade commander's office.  But I will have already have called him first to let him know the bags are coming and then  you can get your bags from the brigade commander.  How about that?  He's like, you wouldn't dare. I'm like, okay.  You want me to hit dial?  I got his number right here.  You really want me to hit dial?  Because he told me, I'm the one that's in control of this.  If you have a problem, he said, call me personally.  So I got a problem. You want me to get my call?  I got no problems with that.  Oh, yeah, he fucking his head exploded.  And as soon as his head exploded, he picked up his bags and walked away.  Yeah.  I'm like, and he was some staff captain in fucking one of the Italians.  I don't know where the break.  I don't fucking remember.  But yeah.  No, ain't got fucking work here.  Oh, it is not gonna work.  You are not dropping your bags here.  That's funny.  Yeah, he was so fucking livid.  Like, you know what, in about three hours you can bring your bags back  with the rest of the chalk that is getting on the next plane?  They and dropped your bags.  They go be with their family.  He just wanted to drop his bag early because he wouldn't have to do that in interrupt his family time.  I'm like, look at here, how many other motherfuckers have families here?  You ain't the only one that's fucking special.  Everyone guys want to fucking spend time with their families before they bore that fucking airplane.  No.  And he was the only one that I had issues with.  Thank goodness.  Because after being up to 58 hours, yeah, no.  I was not a very happy person.  I bet not.  Yeah, that's crazy.  So after all of that happened and getting those 34 whatever brand new privates and  after the bag drought dropped commence I pulled my staff together I said I'm  going to fuck home and you'll see me and this was at and probably about three  o'clock me afternoon I say you'll see me the day after tomorrow my I seen fucking  coming in tomorrow. I think I slipped up fucking noon the next day.  It's crazy. Yeah, I think I slipped like 16, 17 hours. I was fucking so exhausted.  That's that's that was the mission. Yeah, but those all those privates, you know, they knew  I met business. But of course, they're all E1 to in a couple of E3s, you know, versus in an E7,  Okay, you're really not gonna have too much of say so, but in turn, I also told him after I gave him a fucking brief and do not do this this is missed.  And I told him that three times do not do this this and this. I said you don't get him more warnings. You've gotten your three warnings right now.  The next time is you see MJ actions  Try me  couple them tried me  But in turn I said if anybody has a fucking issue  You better come and see me  Because if you have an issue  We need to get it resolved  right and  the few of them had some issues and  We got those issues  Resolve because they could do it at their level  So we could head to my level, it got resolved.  And they were like, damn, this ass hole, fucking does what he says going to do.  Right?  So, I told you, you don't have to respect me as an individual, but I give less than  a day of me.  You ain't gonna hurt my feelings.  But by God, you better respect these fucking, this rank I have on my fucking collar.  I earned them.  Right?  Yeah, that's some main thing.  I would do that.  I would freak in respect to rank, but there's a few people I dealt with.  I did not respect them at all.  So, man.  Yeah, I had a couple of them fucking threatened to go to EO and I'm like, you want the  fucking number?  I got it right here.  You know, I have found that will squat just about anybody's argument.  you throw that. I'll bet him. Yeah. And then I, you know, there, I'm not going to call someone. So  you want to use my phone. Yeah. Exactly. Here's the number you want to use my phone.  The only thing I pulled them, I said, the only thing I want you to do is you better spell my name  fucking correctly. Right? That's it. Anything else? Okay. But you better spell my name, right?  It's you're gonna go that far.  But I'll give you the phone and let you call them.  I'll step out of the office.  I will step out of my office even and go have a smoke while you call them.  How about that?  Yeah, that squashed that EO thing pretty quickly.  Yeah.  No, no, I found I found even out here in the world, you know, people,  Well, I'll just do this. I'll do that here. You want to use my phone? It sheds them up just because  They're not expecting it. It's like I don't give a fuck who you call  You're wrong. I'm gonna tell you you're wrong and please call them. You know call the cops. I don't give two shits  Yeah, you know, but yeah, I've done that a few times in it. It works  And the thing is, when it happened, I didn't even think about it.  It just came out, you know.  Yeah.  Why had that one, didn't?  Uh-huh.  I had that one down.  Call anybody you want.  I'll get you there.  I'll find their number for you.  And you can do that.  And you can use my song.  And it usually was like a real,  It was like a real, just the air out of their bubble so quickly.  Oh, yeah.  It does.  It's great.  And it came out so quickly.  It sounded like this.  And it's even more fun if they're drunk.  Because then they really don't know how to act.  Well, you know, and I can tell you with my experience, I never, ever went.  Now I had team parties at my house or we'd have a platoon party at the, you know, the  infantry platoon sergeant's house.  And yes, people would be drinking, okay.  But as far as to go out to a bar with anybody and watch them get drunk and just become  stupid.  No.  I'm not going to do that.  That's just it.  The only time I did that was when I was over in Korea because I was the designated Walker  for about three guys.  And so when you say a designated walker, what do you mean it?  Well, we were over in Camp Casey right across as soon as you got up post was TDC, Tongue  to Sean.  And they had the, you know, they had the bar strip and someone like that.  So when I went out with those guys, I didn't drink.  They bought me sodas and or water.  I was a day and because we didn't have that. Okay. Yeah, you probably you say you fry you by  I'll buy you fly  Exactly. So basically I'd be the one that had the reason  to get them back on the post and get them onto the bus and get them where they needed to go  Because they weren't gonna fucking make it they basically kind of the designated driver, but we had to walk every place  So I was like, we didn't walk her.  And I will say now, no, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure about TDC, but where I was at in South Korea,  just outside just in a wish on boot right there.  When we went out to the bill, everything was on a hill.  And I'm telling you, walking down wasn't too bad.  Well, it was easy.  It was getting back.  There was the bitch.  I was terrible. I was, I remember one night I couldn't make a bag of this hill and I had two  captains come walk, saw me and I was on the side alley. They come walking down and I was,  I mean, I was falling down drunk and they grabbed me, half carried me, drug me to the gate.  I'm old enough my my ID going through and and they were flyboys. They were cool, but  And what was funny their barracks was  Mine was right behind theirs  So we was going to the same street would  Which was just passed to gate and so we made it to the street  They was gonna walk on up for a little while they were  whatever. And they asked me if I was okay, I said, yeah, I'll make it up. But yeah, so it was up  another fucking hill. And then of course I did. Yes. Oh, it did, man. And then I had about  another 10, 15 stairs. And then I think I was, if I remember right, I was on the second  floor. So yeah, that night was really bad.  I have no like stairs for a long time.  So, but you've been on Casey, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's that's where I am processed at.  Okay.  The turtle farm.  Yeah.  Correct.  Okay.  So you remember where the front gate of Casey was in comparison to the turtle farm, right?  By the money.  About a mile and a half.  Yeah.  Okay, our barracks were another mile up to road by the division mess hall.  Oh, like that was all the way at the end of the post.  Go to the division mess hall, hang a right, and then you had to go up a hill.  Big hill to get to the barracks.  Right.  It was almost three miles from our barracks to the front gate.  Yeah, I'm not doing your fucking ass, I got damn far.  If you don't make a fuck  So man, you miss a bit. You miss a sibriella  You we in the cookie. You know what?  We miss we miss the fucking last boss  I'm just well, I'll get you on post. That's not a problem  but I'm gonna prop you up against the fucking  the MP stand and  I'm gonna fucking walk my ass back to the barracks, and I'm gonna be fucking kicking every goddamn rock  from there to the fucking barracks because you made me miss the last fucking bus.  Right? We never missed the last bus.  I'll put that to you.  I'll go ahead.  I was going to say that's where that's where my barracks was right there at the gate,  at the back gate.  So yeah, I was I didn't I didn't I didn't have to catch a bus like like some people did  Yeah, yeah, no  Yeah, it was it was nice for me  Yeah, kind of sucked for us. Yeah  But the good thing was that I never lived in a quanza hut with three other motherfuckers  What do you mean?  My Joe's  They lived in the quanza hut  Oh my, and then it was four quants of huts then a common bathroom and then four more  quants of huts all with four beds per room.  Yeah, thank God I was in hand seal man I was fucking hated life living that close to three  other motherfuckers.  No, thank you.  only had one other roommate and that was my team chief.  So he couldn't get any more fucking cozier with the team.  He said what we had to be.  I get to say, this is actually the first time I looked at camp Casey on Google maps.  And oh my god.  I didn't realize camp Casey was this freaking big.  Oh yeah.  But yeah, it was it was huge.  Yeah, that was the biggest base on the north side of Seoul between Seoul and North Korea.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I knew, I knew it was big.  I just didn't know it was this big.  But back then, I only spent a couple days on Camp Casey and I was actually restricted  Mostly because I was new in country.  You know, and yeah, when you go into a new country  like that, it's like first three days or a week,  you have to stay on both.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it being the terminal farm.  Yeah.  You didn't have too much freedom.  No.  No, did not.  And Brian.  Why am I just,  Why might you think we called it the turtle farm?  Not a day, I can figure it was what there were tanks there.  Now, is it took you 365 days  to go from one building to the next,  which was right next to each other  for the imp processing and the out processing.  We're 20 feet away.  But it took you a year to get there.  I hope. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Is you in process and then when you well process, you had, right to the next door.  Yeah, right to this building. 20 feet away. Yep.  That was a long fucking wait. Yeah, what is that?  I can play sucked. I'm not gonna get that point. I mean, honestly, I mean,  I went mine. I went mine going back to Korea just to see it, you know, but see it on my terms.  Yeah. You know what I mean?  And the difference being single and being married, that's what fucking was the kicker.  Let's say I was single one. I was over there the first time. So I mean,  I didn't really have a problem.  Well, yeah, I did. Yes, you did.  Yeah, well.  And, but see, you gotta go back.  Well, here.  Look, let me look it up.  Let me see that.  I gotta get a visa and all that kind of shit.  No, you can use your passport.  You know, it's a passport.  I don't have a passport.  I gotta get a passport.  That's easy.  That's real fucking easy.  I know it is.  I just...  I mean, that's just fill out a few questions.  A couple hundred bucks.  It's your gone.  Holy, it.  What?  Do save your pennies, man.  If you flew commercial, go into Camp Casey back to Camp Casey.  You can find a round trip ticket for about $744.  Wow.  Yeah. And one way ticket started for 68.  Well, yeah.  That's cheap.  Yeah, that is fucking extremely cheap.  Yeah, it is.  So yeah, I mean, you know, what was the cost of business class or first class?  Yeah.  You want to be a boozy, don't you?  And then after you give me those answers, I'm like, have you find one more section?  Oh, yang will be able forward this.  From Los Angeles to Seoul.  So you would have to go to Los Angeles and fly the soul 18,092 dollars.  All right.  That's what first class first class.  Yeah.  Generally, it says between 16,474 and 21,196 dollars.  Yeah.  I don't want to I don't need to fucking own the aircraft.  I just want to use a seat on it.  Now here's the next one.  Where's the smoking section at?  They all.  The International.  What do you land?  No.  International flights.  When you cross a day line, you can smoke.  Normally.  Not on any aircraft that's out of the United States.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, when we, when I flew to Korea, we had to wait till the  international date line. And then they told us we could smoke. And then when I left Korea coming  back, we could smoke. And then when we hit the international date line, they flipped it on because  we was in American airspace and they said no more. So we couldn't smoke no more.  Oh, okay. So yeah, no, I remember that.  Well, I bet you I bet you you probably you can't smoke on any aircraft period anymore.  around the world. Yeah, they don't they don't have those restrictions. America is about to  own one that does. Maybe it's fewer countries. Well, and maybe if you're flying Korean  airline or you know, something like that, we have that as possibility. Yeah. Well, these, these  flights, these prices that I'm quoting are flying on Korean airline. Oh, okay. And that's  like business class flights to South Korea is 24 hundred bucks.  Premier, Premier, premium Econ class, I don't know what that means, is 573.  Let me see what, yeah, that's just crazy man.  Well, yeah, because the first class is a fucking, your seat turns into a fucking bed.  Literally a fucking bed.  Yeah.  well I'm not fucking just just that's just like fucking hotel I'm  written to bed for fucking one night I'm not buying the goddamn room well that's  true better about yeah and see yeah e Econ class premium Econ class is about  573 and economy class which is the poor people section from 447 the pole  folk. Yeah, but still, you can make it to Korea in about 14 hours. Yeah, I know it was a miserable  flight the first time. Yeah, but see, just think you'd be going as a billion. Yeah. It's a whole  different way. Well, yeah, you're exactly right. It's a whole different ball wax. I don't know.  There's a lot of places in this country. I still need to see like schedule same here.  Appalachian Trail. As far as my biggest bucket list thing is to travel the Appalachian Trail.  I'm sure not to, sure the fuck not going to walk it like some people do.  It's an Appalachian Trail, the next previous Appalachian Trail. Come on!  God, I would drive right next to it. I ain't walking fucking  I'm 1,392 miles or whatever the fuck  the distance is on that.  And now there are people my age that have walked the fuck.  I'm going to you.  You walk it.  You know what?  That 80 year old individual.  Yeah, what?  I'll drive by and toss you out of bottle of water.  Shoot.  Shoot.  That's not shake his hand.  Hurry.  Well, you're back in the car.  energy keep going. Well, you know, like I said, you know, toss them out of bottle of water.  Hopefully it doesn't hurt them too bad when it's flying 30 miles an hour. But I wouldn't  be that read. You didn't really get out and give it to him, right? Probably. Okay. I feel a  little better than you feel a little bit more. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The reason why I was  late tonight is because I had to be the supervisor of the shit show.  Hey, my, my neighbor, the one that just bought the house across street from us.  He just got station here for good.  It's a younger couple, just like the neighbors that moved to me on the right  hand side who will shit all, all three of them.  So we'll have to write them here, young couples.  And then I'm going to cross the street from me as a younger couple as well.  but yeah. And now we are found out the other day that the MOS that he has was the same  of the OS that I was, which was the 13th Fox. Okay. So we got that in common. But yeah, he's  he purchased an older pickup truck because he has one of those 7.2 liter or six seven or whatever  the fucking, the big Chevy fucking motor is on that full side, jacked up.  Take some shit.  It's a little tough.  It did.  Okay, I believe you.  I don't remember what he said.  So he lives here and where obviously where he works.  Oh, it's about close to 40-mile drive.  It's about 45 miles or 45 minutes from my house to what my unit was back on Fort Hood.  So think how much gas that's on bitch eats.  That's 7.3 or whatever leader it is.  Well, it's exist where I was gonna say it depends on how hard he pushes on this.  Any pedal.  You are absolutely you are without a doubt correct. He's kind of a heavy slitted individual  of that unique pedal. So based upon conversation, I haven't seen him drive, but based on conversation,  his right foot is a little bit heavier than his left foot.  So he bought this, you know, little Nissan,  and not a full, you like the cabin a half, basically.  Hold and he's not pick up truck with the extended cab.  And he's trying to, you know, get everything fixed  because let's see, his daughter was born three days ago,  four days ago.  Ah, and he's deploying to, I think it's Poland.  just the quick reactionary force for  Coast where who the fuck are the Russians fighting right now Ukraine Ukraine so they're going to Poland and it's a  rotationaly quick reactionary force, but it's a nine-month deployment and  he deploys in  sometime in November  Okay  So he got this little pickup truck and he's trying to get everything fixed up his old one, but  Yeah, he said he's fucking his gas bill is like  30% of what he was spending on the big truck  No, don't die better. But he's trying he's trying to get everything fixed on it before he gets deployed  so  He's got he replaced the throttle body sensor  No, yeah throttle body sensor  But didn't replay and the map sensors on order  He has to go by the oh two sensors  But when he replaced the map sensor the car just went into fucking retard mode and just  lame. There you go. Ficking me. Yeah.  Ridden in the head. And I really. Yeah. And so now he's trying to figure out what  fucked up or what electronic sensor is not talking to this sensor, not allowing the truck  to run. So now he's got the map sensors on order. Just throttle body. The one that he bought  that was for that truck. If you look at the pins in them are completely different set up.  Now it goes, it clicks in, but the setup is just completely different. So we're like, okay,  That could be his name.  Rob right there.  Well, and we put the old sensor back in, but it's still running that.  So something has hit.  Dumbass mode and something isn't talking to something else.  Hey, how will we?  Right.  So yeah, the fuel filter that he bought today,  The one that was for that particular truck was not the one that was actually in the truck  So if then he had to go we had to figure out the number of the one that he had in the truck  Not for the Nissan and go get that one  Because the true one was a whole he did completely different set up. It's like  I think that's the thing.  So what a kind of truck did he get.  The one he's worked on, the one that he got was a 19,  92 Nissan extended cab.  His big truck is the fucking big Chevy 7.3 liter V8.  seven point three liter V eight fucking diesel.  One of the fucking big Chevy trucks.  It's got a six inch lift.  And this is all come from the factory like this.  Six inch lift, nice rims, 35 inch tires, $98,000.  Good. God.  Yeah.  That hurts.  I know he, okay. It hurts me. All the way to Louisiana and hurts. Or a Mississippi, or  I should say to Mississippi, if it's hurting you, man, it's hurting for quite a distance, yeah?  Yeah. $98,000 is what he paid for that pickup. He told me. I'm like, you know what?  and his wife is also in the military, so it's still military.  But it's like, you know what?  Yeah, I'm glad you got that kind of money.  Well, it is.  You know, honestly, if you asked me,  because I mean, when we were in, you know,  I mean, you could walk on any car ride,  drive off in anything.  Well, it's true.  I mean, literally, because they knew  they were gonna get their money.  Yes, there was no doubt in their mind because they just, they're going to take a right  out your check, you know, or story systems, whatever you wanted you could get.  And let me ask you since you was in a Navy, did you have access to stuff like that or  no?  No, I mean, you got, I mean, they would, they would offer your, your expenses if you were  were going from station to station.  Yeah, no, no, no, I mean, I mean, like, like,  when, uh, no, when, when you was on, I guess surely  is what it is for you.  Uh, did you all have the shops to where, you know, you  could go buy the big string TVs or the stereo's or.  We can out exchange because what we have no no I mean I mean I mean I mean was there but I mean  when you went off post  Because I  Okay, in the arm. No because in the wrong  that  What was the name of that damn  that  one of the one on the  kid, they're in the name of the day.  I don't wear parked on.  I mean, it was when I  got off, it was just, you  know, you were right there at  basically at the bridge.  So you didn't, you know, there  wasn't any other really  any stores around now.  You know, they met all the,  all the stuff back odd dealers  around.  You know, you go a little ways  down down the strip.  And yeah, you had the  You had the car dealers hanging out there selling you a car for you know 30%  Interest and stuff like that  Yelling because you know the government if you  If you the government will make you pay it back  They were they will will  Garnish your wages. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No. No. Yeah, but no you say I didn't know because they like in the army  every post is built near a town. If not, buddy, right up next to it, it's not  more than a couple miles away. Okay, and then in city he drove through  normally it's the back gate. That's where you had all the rent-to-own places for  anything you wanted. And then there was car dealerships and of course, everybody  be an intermediary. They'd be like, oh yeah, we've got the foreign will just, you know, process  it, sign here with this process and take it right. Yeah, you'll get everything you get.  You'll get what it would call you once. You can get blams making new, drive off to, you know,  100% financing. Wouldn't even put down payment. Oh yeah. Yeah, like I said, didn't mention that,  that there was a, that there was how much interest was and most guys being young enough,  they didn't even care. They weren't paying attention for it. Well, yeah, I mean, I mean,  if we were young, you know, we didn't have no, we had no idea about interest. Right.  No, no, reason I'm asking this because since you went on shit, where did you keep the stuff  to buy. You know, like, like, say that I'm, unless you had a, unless you had an apartment.  Okay. Did you, when you were not on the ship as a single soldier, did they have barracks room?  No. Nope. You stayed on the ship. Really? Yeah. Okay. So,  where do you call your personal shit at when? And you're in a cop and locker? Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't have a lot of stuff there.  Now, now from time to time, if you knew somebody, there had a, like an air conditioning unit  in their space.  And they were clear with it.  They were bad.  They don't let you, they're what you stood there.  But you know, you had to be able to, you had to be able to put your, your stuff in  the, and it's the head just  bookstore. And it had to be able to be get put away.  Now you could point where when we were on the way, there  was actually a lot of times we would actually take, I  would utilize the overhead space and I would take like some extra  stuff that I had and I would stuff it up in to the up in the, in  the pipes and stuff that was over that was in the overhead,  because I was low band on the totem pole with me and I got the top rack.  Okay. So yeah, you might be able to set up, but you're going to be setting up your heads,  going to be at a bunch of pipes and things like that. So right. Okay. Yeah.  Yeah. I can't say we had actual rooms, you know, in buried. And so we could keep the stuff in  our rooms. Yeah. No, I mean, I mean, I mean, I went, I kind of asked a question in kind of a long  way. I didn't mean to just as this was. That's that work, man. Yeah. Yeah. You know, sometimes  we've got to ask it to ask backwards. Okay. So when you're back at your home base, you are still  Sleeping on this the ship  right  Yep  Okay, so  you didn't have  No big TV obviously  Nope, there you go. I only TV had was sitting in the  Sitting in the entertainment room  That's crazy  Daniel did you have were you single doing your life in the middle? No, I was I as married  Okay. So what did the single soldiers do with their vehicles?  Oh, you depart from, they had parking. You said, have base parking and you had to have it  and all that. So you know, you just had to have proper documentation and insurance and all  that kind of stuff. Right. Right. So I mean, that's all we really had to have. So because  several times where, you know, if we were underway, like when we were doing, when we were  doing our, our west back, you know, no one's out in the car for six months. Yeah, but  what it was it in a pretty much secured area. Yeah, it's a security. It's on base. Well,  Oh shit, we got on base too, but we fucking know secure parking areas.  I remember I remember I had a pair of Kenwood 6 by 9 and old old old bill and those  sons of bitch has got stole.  Oh shit.  And my car was locked up, arct and everything.  I always upset because they was like, I think I think it was playing all together 600  $1 and for two six point I  it's yep on that easy payment plan dude  I was all about that easy payment plan now  and and they what they gave you fucking huge rocks as  Lou bright  well that's all time I didn't feel it when  that guy's yeah I got to say because I  I started saving him, bitches.  I was not happy.  Well, I had, you know, he wasn't my roommate but lived in the barracks.  Yeah, the stereo system that he fucking bought.  And this was 80...  87.  And I mean, he had to freaking tower.  This was for room not for vehicle.  He had to tower speakers.  He had every fucking component.  it even had a reverb. Oh my God. Oh, so he went rare. He went annoying. He didn't just  go off and share his music. He made sure his music was knowing as possible. Sometimes, yes.  Yeah, I should pay for that system back in 1987. Uh, it's about 2,500 bucks, I think.  No, no, no, no, no, a little bit more than double that, almost $6,000.  I mean, it was, yeah, I remember too, because we used to have a, I used to love to go to,  I can't remember the name of the damn store in Amarillo. There was just a,  it basically, that's all they were about, was a stereo store. And you saw my couple times in the  movies. There were these clear, this clear radio. I didn't after see the CDs came about. And it was  this. It had a clear acrylic or glass cover that went over all the components. But what you did is it  actually had one of the first instances as I saw of motion activated. And you, when you want to do  something you went your hand in front of the, uh, in front of the, the panels and they would  slide apart. And then you could actually make changes and stuff like that. It was both  size of a large boom box. But I mean, and the, the speakers themselves, they were, they were  separated, but, and they were probably about maybe a foot and a half tall each one, maybe  maybe taller probably close to two foot. But it was all clear also everything all that was clear  with it. And so it was just that was way cruel. But yeah, that thing was like $1,500. And I was  just like, soon I look a bitch, damn it, I'll never be able to afford that. Someone's got to be  stupid rich to be able to afford that. Yeah. And then you find it. I'm a brand new. I don't know,  even back then I've one of the reasons the the finance gods have never liked  even in even whenever I was first out of school a lot of my friends they were able to go off get  get credit card things like that I would try from time times I got  scum sugar and everybody was like like yeah I get a credit card we'll give you t-shirts  So, hell yeah, I got free t-shirts,  because I'd go, be walking around Emerald College  and there'd be someone there,  growing t-shirts at you if you fill out a,  an application for a card.  And eventually I realized it's like,  yeah, they're basically gonna look at my credit  and go, hell, fuck no, and just laughing for you.  I'm okay, we'll ride on the t-shirt for him.  And I, I had a, one of those,  finally got one of those starter cards  where you actually have to pay you $500 first  and then they started up.  And so you end up with credit limit is half that amount.  Yeah, just a secure credit card.  It's a secure credit card.  And I tried that once.  And I mean, that was a big pay on the ass  because I was like, yeah, okay, well, you know,  and I've got paid and I was like,  all right, let's throw some extra money over to that.  What's have a secure credit card and yeah, yeah, that was that was the disaster and a half so I was like, you know  What now apparently whatever they whatever they're all the rhythm is that tells you hey this guy's not good at with money  No, they was probably good because  The few times I'll I even tried to probably the system to where I might be able to get something like that  It was like yeah, okay, that's why they said no. I mean that  I got spent a little time in jail for a hot check and so after that I realized, yeah,  I'm gonna pay him a check.  No more.  We're not gonna, we're just, it's all, I'm on a cash, cash per cash basis and that's  all we're doing.  Right.  The long time.  That's what it was and it's still basically cash, but it's just, I just use a debit card  now.  Yeah.  That was funny.  But yeah, you know, it's funny, you know, we're all sitting here talking about what  we used to do and everything.  You know, if there's any younger people listening to this later on, they're just going to crack  up.  They're going to be like, what the hell, man?  Life is hard.  And life is the same now as it was back then.  It's just people take it and what they're going through and they make it more personal  nowadays.  Right.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  How about woke?  Now, here you go. Don't woke. Wake the fuck up.  Exactly. Yeah, there's a different people being woke and wake.  And wake. Yeah.  It's amazing that one, they're allowed to breed.  And two, and don't get me wrong. You know, my neighbor just, their daughter is  almost a week old and congratulations, you know, younger couple, you know, but some of these  people out there? Yeah, I'm sorry, but some of them should not be breeding. Yeah. And I'm  sure my mom said the same thing about my generation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's funny,  you know, all these, all these, all these New York kids there. I'm like, oh, this is so  know, you know, and they're saying all this. They don't realize that they're great, great,  great, great, great, great, great grand daddy. It's the same exact words. Yeah. You know,  I mean, back then back back five grades. The words might have been a little different, but  the meaning was the same. Right. Yeah, they didn't use skippity. Right. So the bell  bottoms. They just they just this generation just thinks they are the shit that they  have well bottoms. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. Back in fucking the 70s they had them then too.  Yeah. I I had a few paragins that was uh uh that were a bell bottoms late 70s I think.  I never had any PD or something.  I didn't like your money.  I think I wanted to pair and I didn't really like it.  Well, they did a really good job at school,  making it where we didn't want them anyhow.  Because this is back when first second grade,  just after the bell bottoms,  because they were talking about them there in school,  you don't want to use bell bottoms  small riding bikes because you might get your, uh, get your, uh, belt bottom pants, uh, caught  in there. And then all of a sudden you go to rack and, and die. And so, well, I don't know  that's truly you wind up going over to handle bars. So that's true. I know that, but it's  that that that is a proven fact. Yeah, we could do what did it. Yeah, once or twice.  Yeah, I want to tell you.  Oh my god. Yeah, that was yeah, it's that hurt. I'm telling you because I was normally riding on gravel  Not the road. I was riding on gravel when yeah, that man. Mmm. Oh  Fucking hearts. Yeah, that's why that's why I'm I am. I am right pantley was always rolled up  Yeah, or you had one of those bike or  a class for your pants.  Yep. Yep.  Or a clothespin or something, anything to keep.  I say, get pants on any.  Right. Yep.  But the men in the words of Archie Bunker, those were the days.  Yeah, right. Right.  But the most fun on a bicycle I had really with clothespin and a playing card.  Man, I sound is like a motorcycle dude. Yep. That was I agree with that  That was awesome and then when you put  Four on the front right spoke or the front. Yeah, right spoke of them or  Four I should say two on the left front fork  two on the back  On either side so you had eight  You know what that sounded like?  No, I never did that sounded like shit.  Now I just did one mate.  I think I tried two but went back to the one.  That one sounded cooler.  Yeah, eight sounded like shit.  One sounded cool.  That's the case where more is not better.  More was not better by far. Yeah, that's just sound like I  Can't even describe the sound really  That's how that's how fucked up it was you really couldn't describe the sound  That's crazy too much fucking chatter  Yes, but it was fun. Yes, it was  I mean, you get that.  You get those couple pieces of two by fours and that broken up piece of my would.  I would.  Yes, sir.  And you had a mother.  You had a motherfucking ramp.  Yeah, you did.  And you were cool.  Go.  And if you weren't careful, you crack your nuts on that center bar across the bike right  underneath the sea.  Oh, that's, yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking made me cry. I mean, I bought like a baby because I jumped the ramp. I was going good  I jumped the ramp and I  I caught air and I was root happening. I landed and and  The weld where where those bars come together on the on that  Main half you know going down the front tire the weld broke oh  and I was still standing up when I landed, so I didn't bust my tailbone, but the forward momentum  when I landed, I wound up missing the seat and I mean, I freaking balled myself right  onto that bar and just rolled off right there, cumbling.  goes running. I mean, I was mad because I couldn't write a bike no more. I had to go get it  re welded, which I had to pay for. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it costs me like two bucks.  But two bucks was a lot of fucking money. You got damn right. That was 20 power bottles, dude.  I had to find that I was a kid to do bucks, you know, but I found them. I was back riding in a couple days  But I didn't I didn't jump the bike after that. I was too scared that hurt  That that well would fucking break. Yeah, I fucking believe that  Yeah, that yeah, I was not expecting that at all  And when you and I'm sure when you got home and you're still crying your mom says  shut the fuck up or I'm gonna give you something to cry about.  Right?  Or is like, well, you're dumbass, junk to bike,  and you weren't supposed to, so you got what you deserved.  Oh, yeah, there was no sympathy.  No, because it wasn't official dirt bike that you had, correct?  No, it wasn't.  Okay.  Oh, I know which bike you're talking about,  because I had one of those.  It was an old 26 inch bike.  I could be.  See how the yard seal,  and when I first got it,  I almost couldn't ride it.  I wasn't big enough yet,  but it didn't take long.  And I grew, and yeah, man,  I rode that bike fucking everywhere.  Yeah, because if you didn't ride that bike everywhere,  guess what?  You were fucking walking everywhere.  Yes, sir.  That's right.  That was a lot slower.  Yes.  Was the more time consumption.  And yeah, that just wasn't working right.  So I just tried to bike, be a lot quicker.  You know, and I had to,  and in high school, we did not have buses,  like they did school buses.  My town didn't have school buses.  What the hell, belt?  Yeah, we didn't have school buses.  What did you have?  That's what I mean.  We had fucking LPCs.  Leather, personnel, carriers.  So grade school for me was a block and a half from my house.  Junior High, it was a mile from my house.  house. And if you wanted, if you had the money to fucking ride on the public buses, you could  ride on the public bus. But you fucking walked a mile each way, every day to school, to high  school, that was more than 20 miles round trip easily. Yeah, you took the fucking, the regular  city bus or if you had a bicycle and you fucking got your ass up early enough in the morning  You get a ride your bike to school  But it was yeah, well one of these days I'll look up the distance from my house to the high school  but it was  10 15 miles one way  walking a half  for me  Yeah, I was in between out junior high and high the high school  And we were walking a half both ways.  Yeah, and I'm sure that in from kindergarten to high school,  your town was so big that you stayed in the same fucking room.  No, no, no, actually, we had a kindergarten.  Well, it's actually I didn't go to kindergarten in that town.  I went to kindergarten over in Maine, Oklahoma.  But about first grade, it's second grade, third grade,  grade their primary for 5th 6th 7th 8th 7th 8th, I don't know 4th 5th and 6th, they were in  so there was the primary that was the elementary junior high was the 7th and 8th and then  you went over to high school for the last four or nine, 10, 11, 12.  Oh, uh, I mean, we had a pretty decent school. I mean, we had, you know, to, but essentially  right around 2,000 people all the time. It was usually about 19, 50 to somewhere along that.  Nowadays, I think they're actually up, they broke the 2000 finally. But yeah, how many was it?  How many was in your graduating class? How did you? 42. Yep. Mine was little over 1300.  And the guy didn't have buses.  No, we did not have buses.  That is crazy.  I mean, in town kids didn't have buses, but the out of town kids were bused in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we, uh, I didn't get that luxury.  Yeah, there was no school buses and Lincoln, Nebraska in any way she performed.  They still had wagons.  Close.  And that was a lot of fun walking in the wintertime to junior.  I bet it was.  Yeah.  That was a blast.  I remember high school walking.  Just walking the block in a half.  And by the time that I was back when I was, you know, it was cooler to go ahead and just  take a shower.  First thing in the morning and stuff.  So I'd get out, get myself all brushed my head and all that, and get by the time I got to the school.  If depending on how the wind was blowing my hair froze in some funky direction.  I would always, always have my hair in some weird position if what didn't want it to be.  Well shit, you did it.  And you just never changed, did you?  because your hair is just in all kinds of different positions.  Now it still looks windblown, but that's one reason why I'm now just basically just  Caesar and just get it as short on top as a possible can and shorter on the sides.  Yeah, see I like bold.  If I didn't have to shave, I would.  I probably like bald too, but.  Well, yeah.  it bad enough. I've been this summer. I've been shaving the old old face again and  Yeah, I'm a little bit more isn't it? Not really. It's about the same  All you could put says it was just what would collect in your beard and it would become you know it would be a  It was like a  An air conditioner it would keep it cool. Oh, okay  Yeah, no, can't do that. That drives me a little bit too much insane. Just like having  have an air touch my ears now. You are compared to what I had when I was in high school.  That'll never happen again. Right. Well, that is all received into my back now. So  I just I don't have long enough arms to break that.  But I could break my hair in high school.  Now of course I didn't, but I couldn't have.  Yeah, I tried going bald ones.  I could not see you with the bald.  I really can't.  Anyway, was you brilliant? I could not see a bald.  I've done, I mean, I've done the whole  the  West pack haircut.  Do where you just buzz everything off by the time you get to your first, your first  protocol.  It's usually grown out of nowhere.  It looks all of it.  But yeah, I know.  I lived that in basic training.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got an AI team.  AI team to have iron kite.  Yeah.  I'll be back in a few minutes.  Okay.  All right.  to go I said I would show it's a and that high and tight.  Well, no, hi.  Maybe if you're lucky at quarter of an inch, was your high?  But you know, I have nothing.  And it just wasn't.  Well, I had enough.  I had enough trouble with the with the first class, but he also  thrown a shit fit about how whether I was shaved or not shaved. Well, if I ended up shaving  ever freaking day if they want you to shave, I'd look like I used the Bobcat shaving system.  That's where you take it and grab a Bobcat bites with a scruff of snake. Take the thumb,  ram it up. It's bright and use it. Use the foot. Yeah. Well, we had the fucking shave every fucking day.  the  all the rest of the birds. You know, I was never let, well, I wouldn't say fortunate.  I guess I'd have to say thankful right. I'll say once a day. Yeah, I shave. I shave at the  most I'll shave every other day. But most of the time, it's, uh, I will, uh, I will shave right  I'm like, these days I'll share about once every three to six days, depending on how lazy  I want to be with it.  Yeah, right now I share once a week.  Yeah.  Cause I can.  Exactly.  Back in those days you didn't have a choice.  No, you're not the one that got to, uh, got to make the decisions as to.  But it's a lot of facial style you wanted.  Yeah. And in the army, understand, you know, people that had shaving profiles  because they got bumps on their necks.  Right? I got that.  Yeah. And, but now all there in the army, there's a very, very loose standard,  The facial hair.  I mean just in common you can have a fucking tight beard in the army now.  Really?  Yeah, that's how loose the standards have gotten.  I think with this secretary of defense, yeah, I think you're a lot of shit is changing.  Right. They're taking the DEI out there. Oh, yeah, I knew they were taking the DEI out there.  What can that thing out? Thankfully? Yeah, they're taking a walk out. They're taking the transgender. Yep.  Yep. And we're going back to the old days. Let's get it. We need it. Yeah, they and even I can't remember.  I was watching on YouTube, but it was, I think it was a segment off of Fox that the  secretary of defense is now allowed the, it trashing of the barracks, like in basic training.  Oh, gosh, you're shit again.  Yeah, they can toss and they can also shark.  What's that one?  Shark is when all the drill sergeant's get around one guy.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  He's bringing that back.  Well, good.  So they're going back to some of the old ways of life.  No more stress cards, well.  And I haven't had stretch cards for some time now, but that whole fucking mindset is going  by by right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And out of that group that I was telling you about earlier, that oh, said battery, that  that timeframe, they had stress cards and basic and AIT.  And that was their mindset.  And we were doing something.  I can't remember what I think it was discipline in a couple of the soldiers, but the whole  group was there.  And one of those soldiers pulled out that stress card.  I said, okay, let me read that stress card.  And D.O.  I don't remember what the hell said.  That's only been fucking what?  2000 and  Five  Maybe 2006 time frame  So it's been what?  19 years ago  So I got that stress card. Yeah, so I get that stress card from that kid and I tear it up into  Confetti and just basically throw back into his face in that he said what he said about it, huh?  And I said now you think about this  You're getting ready to deploy into a fucking combat zone.  Do you really think the enemy gives a fuck?  They want you to be that week.  Yeah.  You think they give a shit about your stress level?  They will fucking shoot your ass all the same.  They don't give two shits about that stress card.  Nope.  What's so ever?  That bullet is going to...  And it is not racially discriminative.  It does.  That bullet don't give a flying fuck.  What color your skin is?  What your religion is, what your background is, it don't fucking care.  It's gonna kill you all the same.  Plain and simple.  You really want to go into a combat zone with that mindset?  You better fucking think that one again.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Stress cards never came out again.  I said, I'm getting ready.  Yes, I'm an asshole.  And I'm getting ready to get you deployed over into a combat zone.  I have two jobs right now.  I told us to every single soldier that I had regardless if they were getting ready to  pull your come back.  I said, there's only two jobs I have right here right now.  One is a train you up for combat and the other one is to get your ass home back alive.  Right.  Anything else is fucking irrelevant.  I don't like to objectives.  So do you think I'm an asshole?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  As I say, wait till you meet the enemy.  Yeah.  The whole purpose is to make you stress so you give up your shit.  Yeah.  So yeah, I don't that don't fucking fly here.  And sure, fuck don't fly in combat.  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  Leave that mindset here and now.  and it's the issue I had with a lot of the folks who wanted to run that style of military.  It's like, okay, well, it proves to us that you are not a, not a, a, a, a, a, a, a  friendly for the, for the United States government because you're too busy worrying about  what, you know, seeing how you cannot put us at a disadvantage for the, uh, for the enemy.  Yeah.  I would be not that have to be too busy yelling at, uh, that senators going, Hey, stop trying  to get us killed.  The, and that's the problem for a long, this wild, the senior command structure was all  about, you know, how many, how many times they could kiss the fucking politicians ass.  Right.  No, you're gonna fucking get somebody kill is what you're gonna do  Let the politics  Yeah  You let the politicians dictate  the fucking  military  You're yeah, you're just gonna fuck everything out and they did that sure the fuck did  but I  I am no longer in, so I don't have to worry about it.  That's right.  I don't think I could survive in the military right now.  Even going back in as my old rank.  Yeah, I wouldn't survive very well.  Because I am not politically correct nor am I politically...  Yeah, I would just say I'm not politically correct.  Here's a type that is NSFW.  you. Not paperwork.  Oh, say for work. I have never heard that one before.  Really? Oh, yeah.  I didn't know. I didn't know what it was for a long time, but you know, you see pictures and you see that in SFW and I'm like,  what's that? I had to look it up. And then in fact, oh,  And then I saw the picture and I saw the NSFW.  Yeah, I can see how that picture would not be safe for work.  Okay. Yeah.  No, my two favorites are LLMF and O-D-F-S.  Last like a motherfucker and I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Out there fucking flapping.  He got him and heard that.  He on.  Yeah, those are my two favorites acronyms.  Yep.  Now, I'm sure I could talk one of the drivers at the other day because he was supposed  to go one way and he messed his exit off of 35 to go to Athens.  And he had it in his mind that he was going to go to in us.  So I guess that's right.  I would go to Athens.  That's right.  It's not the right way.  And then and he had left before I did.  And there was an accident in the traffic  or in the construction area on 35 through Waco  because yeah, that's just a fucking mess again.  Right.  And so it was down to one lane on the highway going north.  And he was in the same traffic jam that I was.  I was just watching people trying their damnness to fucking squeeze in to get one car closer  or one car further up in the traffic jam.  That's always fucking just amazed me.  I'm fucking hilarious about people.  Want to try and get their one car soon.  It's like people were all fucking stopped here.  Why are you trying to?  Yeah, I just, I don't give up.  I just fucking start laughing.  So anyway, we were shit.  We were halfway between Elmont and Hillsboro  when I passed him I  Like why the fuck am I passing this guy?  It's supposed to be his exit was like down a wake up  area and  Already passed elban was that like about  20 miles no not that far. Yeah  From the southern part of wake-up to elban is about 20 miles  And we were north of Elmo and I passed him any, you know, and I get back into the lane in front of him.  He flashes his lights to let me, and then I turn on my hazards to thank him.  And at that particular point in time, he's like, why the fuck am I here?  Why did Ron just pass me?  Well, probably because I was going up to Grand Prairie, and you missed your exit.  your exit and you're lost and I sent him the test. I said, you're just a little bit L. L.  R. L. L. M. F. Because you are way in a fuck out of where you're supposed to be. And  then when he finally fucking replied, it was like, yeah, I fucking missed my exit. Yeah,  that was only about 20 years. So he got off at the next exit and got himself turned  around went back down south so he could get on the correct road to go over to  Athens.  But I was like, man, wow, you fucking lost like a motherfucker today.  That's for damn sure.  Well, well, I laughed at his expense.  So that made my day.  Absolutely.  So what mission since you are back home now, Brian?  What missions have you accomplished since you've been home?  Yeah, let's be here.  I have, yeah, I try to get something to accomplish each day.  See, my day, I got the, I got the cabinets underneath the,  I need to copy the product, I got them cleaned out and got started on the cabinet  that some of the other cabinets that have been needing to be just cleaned out because well we've got we've got stuff and stuff and more stuff that's that's been running around there and and it's just time to get time to get the crap cleaned out and it's just built up and you know just.  We've got, we've got, we've got for Christmas and, you know, and never used or used  wants and never, never touched again, top of stuff.  So we were like, all right, whatever.  You know, I just got to get that cleaned out.  Today I was going to get, I was going to work on the work, work some more on getting some,  some more of the trees knocked down and yeah, they just didn't happen.  I got myself kind of gumption dap. It was already 1230 and I was like, damn, it's already  90 something degrees outside. That's going to really suck. We'll do it tomorrow morning.  So that's what I'm going to try to do tomorrow morning.  But we'll get it all to do it.  Yeah, I got the dog guard mode again, which is one thing, one that I do every time I'm home  just so that the fleas and ticks don't get to out of control. Yeah. And I say we got when  off spent about $200 on the dogs because rain's ears was bothering her and Watson has got  scams on the top of his head. We were going to the hill. We come to find out more. But more we got  to watching him and stuff. He would go to scratch and he'd start off at the back of his neck and  work himself up to the top his head. And so we're thinking he's just got, and he's just  getting over exuberant and is gouching into his skull. So Doc went off and gave him a big  old shot that's supposed to basically knock all the, uh, the allergy problems that he's  got, not get down for about a month. Okay. So he does get allergies or is yes. Yeah,  it's brass.  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  like to hold the grass and everything else in there.  Oh, okay.  It's not uncommon to see him come in from outside and be dragging a, uh,  dragging a chunk of weed and his butt cheeks.  Just, just one day,  it's just,  it got more like that.  Like that's wrong.  It was like, they get, you know,  he got a plank or an hour or a year, but, but,  but again, that's just someone who's,  someone who's someone who's not all that smart.  He just tells us.  That's me, are you?  Oh, I'm talking about Watson right now.  But you know what the shoe fits.  Dang, that's cool.  But now it's just so in rain, her ears, she just  talks it. Yeah, just need to start taking a  a bit of just rubbing alcohol and a big old cotton pad and just wet it up and  start and rustler down to the ground and cleaner ears with that because the  alcohol will dry up the oils that are in the wax and so you can really give it  get it cleaned out pretty well. So there's you have a lot of hair in her ears as  Well, no, no, she's not she's done heavy doodle in her so that's there's not any uh  Not really a problem with hair. It's just she's got big floppy ears and so  They and and then you got Watson and his weird kink of black and loving to lick her ears  so  my phone  and so  So yeah, he has constant lick in and  and stuff just doesn't help it dry out at all.  So just come to help them a little bit of a yeast infection.  Thanks to all the crap that's built up in there.  And no, yeah, okay.  Gotcha.  Yeah, all the moisture.  Yeah.  So, yeah, there's, there's,  there's a front, a front of having cats.  Of course, our good old country doctor  that we have. He that's I think that's the most we have spent at one time at his office  ever. Okay. Most of the time, I mean, most of the time we go in there just to get like  shots and stuff like that and it'll come back on and it'll end up, it'll end up, uh,  not even a not even a hundred dollar bills.  That's it.  Yeah, I mean, that's always, you know, it's like $75, $80, which I mean,  stop incredibly expensive, but at the same time, you know,  I am good to talk about when they take their dogs to the vet and they're like,  God, he really brought a rabbit,  I've been spending $250, $300.  Why do you get a chance without much?  But you say that's the thing people don't don't realize you can tell of that now, you know,  what's there's something cheaper.  Yeah.  I want to talk to just that he's just.  But now we're not taking you to Fox.  It's okay.  Relax.  Well, no, he is staring on this.  He is a country that I mean it is.  actually taken whenever we'd taken him in this to bet what's him to see about his head.  We were expecting him basically to say, well, he's scratching a lot. That's what dogs  do. You get us kind of out of find a way of managing the scratching some. He's just  going to go over there just to just have a bet tells he's he's being a dog. So that'll  be. No, he actually he actually was able to educate you. Yeah. Yeah, he was and he usually  does. He's easily very good about that. Getting it, getting it all taken care of, getting  it nice and nicely resolved. And yeah, and it's not a, uh, it's not being a problem at  I mean he get I said just  Just uh there's what needs to be done and  You don't need to be smell my cotch so get away from it. Yes, you  Yeah, he's a fair and honest individual. Yeah, very nice yells  Yeah, anybody else the best very good any don't it's like name one is money  He's got to find that fair and honest individual. Yeah  Why it's so hard to fucking find a decent mechanic  Yeah, it can't be difficult there. Agri.  Because they're very cheap, fair and honest mechanics out there.  Right.  Yeah, what fucking the dealership around here?  I think they're at $180 an hour labor rate.  Ah, only.  But the one that I go to these, I think you finally raised this price.  He's at $130, $135, $140 an hour.  All right  But again, he they got a fucking charge you  Or something that you don't fucking need  We're gonna fix the problem  That you have it here  Yeah  So that's why I like you know this particular mechanic that I take my jeeps to or  Jeep  Well, all the vehicles actually  All right  What are you not wrong with that?  No, you're gonna start finding good mechanic. Yeah, we got our local mechanic. He's good. He's over. He's busy as all get out  So you may sometimes it may take him a little bit to get to your to your vehicle, but  Yeah, I had yeah, I had one of those shops in  Law and Oklahoma station at Fort Sill where if you had you know a major problem with your car  It would take you fucking a week we can have to get it in because he never did any advertising.  The only advertising that he had was obviously his name was in the phone book because he was a  business and he had business cards sitting on his counter. But other than all of his advertisement  was word of mouth.  Now that's exactly if it's if it's if he does word of mouth and he's a week, we can have  hell. He's a damn good mechanic. Yeah, because I had a Buick, I had a grand damn that I bought  it for brag. And then that's the car that we had at in Oklahoma. And it was when they started  transitioning engines from distributor motors into EFI. But the block still had that that hole  that you could put a distributor into.  Oh, okay.  And it was capped off and with it had a rubber-o-winged, well, the car was shit.  I remember how old at the time when I had the oil leaks that I could not fucking find.  And he was like, this year vehicle, it has this motor.  See that cap right there?  That's where in this trip here, you used to go to.  There's an O-ring in there.  Guaranteed you that it was, the O-ring was cracked.  Guess what?  The O-ring was cracked.  He had to basically take the whole top end of the motor off to get to that piece and charge  to me $98.  Oh my God.  Dude.  I would pay that gladly.  Yeah.  And that's why he was fair.  honest. He didn't give a shit. Well, he did give a shit, but he didn't give a shit about  what you thought the mechanical issue was. You explained it to him and he was going to find  the problem and fix the problem. Right. Plain and simple. Now, of course, if you wanted to buy  I said a fucking tires and rims.  Well, he would sell you tires and rims.  Yeah, he'd order them for you, but if that ain't  what is gonna fix the problem,  then why the fuck are you buying rims and tires?  All right, let's fucking fix the goddamn problem.  And that's the way this shop operated.  Okay.  And it was a bitch to find it initially.  No, it's one of those that's hit the way.  Yeah, there was a strip mall right on one of the main streets and he was behind that strip  mall and you had to go through the back end or kind of like the alley at the end of the  strip mall to get to his shop.  I don't know how many times when I initially was trying to find this guy.  How many times I drove past that fucking, you know, it wasn't a street.  It was just part of the fucking parking lot, but he was behind it.  And you could find that motherfucker to save your life.  Finally, part of them.  Once I did, yeah, he had all my business.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm still looking.  I went in.  I went into that shop that did my brakes because they did to do my ball joints and stocks  and all like that.  The quality give me and just revenue the wrong way and you're saying $3,500.  That's parts of the labor.  And I was just like, that's just too fucking much.  You know.  Yeah, we evolved the weights and what?  Shocks.  Oh fuck, you get the sharks.  fucking change those when I get down there.  Yeah, I can get away.  That long. Oh, yeah, I can. I can't.  That's it's not bad, bad, but I went in like last week.  And I told him, I said, dude, you need to rework that that, uh, that quote.  Cause I says that that's just that's just a little bit outrageous.  And it's a nap a shop.  And there's a nap of warehouse riding town here.  I found out.  I'm good. I can get all four shocks. The steering stabilizer and four ball joints for 800 bucks.  So it's like you went and it charged me $2,700 in labor. I don't think so.  Yeah. No. I told him to rework it and he said he'd call me and he hasn't yet. I think  up this ball. Yeah. The shots. Yeah, the sharks we can fucking do. That's easy. Yeah,  see what kind of sharks were you looking at? I think I think they're running. Uh, it  is. I can't remember. I mean, it's nothing fancy. You know, it's not as, uh, because  the guy I was talking to him and do that actually lied to me because the shocks that  he was looking to put on my Jeep or 250 a shot. And I said, dude, I said, that's the price  of Fox shocks. And he's like, well, this is Napa brand of Fox shocks, Fox makes these shocks.  Well, I got home and I started looking and that's not true. Bill steam and a few  other shock makers make the shocks for Napa box doesn't. So Fox makes for themselves.  Yeah, I know. And that's why I looked it up because because when he said that, I'm like,  uh, no. And it's like, you know, I don't need, I don't need $250. You know, time for  Yeah.  What about the boxes?  Yeah.  Well, if you're going to go there out, then fucking get box shocks.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Pay an price.  I want that fucking name.  Yeah.  Now, Bill steam, those are pretty damn good shocks too.  They're like a real close second to Fox.  Who's that?  The Bill steam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I would not. Now I would not buy red cheroes or hill country.  You mean, rough country or rough country? Yeah, I won't. I won't touch you.  It was those. Yeah. No, it just I was looking at it.  It's like, man, I, you know, you know, I'll spend 80, you know,  75, 80 bucks, whatever on stocks. But I'm not spending 250  because I'm not wheeling that much.  Yeah, I thought it was wheeling constantly.  Yeah, I would have  Fox Fox or something like that.  You know, yeah, we set up that is meant for that particular application.  Yeah. Right. Yeah.  So yeah, no, I mean, I mean, the shocks I can get any time because I mean,  They have it.  And yeah, it's not hard to change the shocks.  And yeah, that's why that's why Wayne praised me.  He praised me, you know, 15 little over 1500 for four shocks in it.  And 300 for a steering stabilizer replacement.  And I'm like, man, no.  I mean, I would, I would, I would suffer in pain and do the job myself. Now the ball joints,  you know, the ball joints are a little more involved in you need an alignment.  You know, when you do the ball joint, well, yeah, you're also going to have to get the fort  to unseat the ball joint. So that you have to have a clamp to resee them. Yeah. So yeah, that's  just a little bit more of another taking. Yeah. Yeah. And so that I mean that, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't  mind. I mean, but yeah, I shouldn't cost no 15, 16 hundred for that. You know, it's not. So that's why I  asked him to rework that because I told him. I said, that's what, that's what, you know, got me  old look as that quote you give me right I'm I'm not afraid to tell someone no I  do you can do better in that I know you can but I still haven't heard nothing  but I mean I'll probably wind up just buying stocks will do them when you get  down here. There's a ball joint saying, ain't bad, bad, bad. But they will make noise. Okay.  But I will send you a point of contact. His name is Dylan Nance. And he's a distributor for a lot  off-road parts. And like that box that I have in the back of my Jeep, right? I like paid  $420 for that box. That's not bad. New things out, you know, you go to off-road or some  other company and they're running, you know, over $600 for that box. Yeah, he gives a military  people discount. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, I've got to do something about the back of my Jeep.  I've got tools of back there. And I need to actually kind of claim it up. You know, you know,  I mean, it works for me. I mean, I mean, no one rides with me. Well, well, a belladow, they do now.  Normally, bellarizing the front seat. Now,  I was in Jeep today and I opened up the back and Bella jumped in on her own and then,  you know, jumped on out when it was time to go. So that was good. Yeah. But yeah, normally,  normally she sits off in the passenger seat and just lays down like, okay,  You don't want to see.  You don't want to see.  Nope.  I'm good.  Just drive.  8.  Yeah, exactly.  Drive.  Jeez.  Right.  I saw.  I just want to be able to hold the tires.  Yeah, that's actually what shocked me because, because, you know, when I brought her home,  I was like, you know, that's exactly what you did.  Got in front seat and laid down.  Okay.  Yeah, I was afraid.  You know, she'd throw up or something like that.  Nope.  That's cool.  Yeah.  I don't think.  Looks like it is about time.  Stop bringing this old bird onto the ground.  So guys, I want to say thank y'all very much.  We were the, the, I'm an attention in the, and the, and the work that, that people are trying to  kind of put in for the show. We started growing a little bit from what I was able to peak. It's not  much, but at the same time, I think it's more of the fact that it's, uh, summertime schools actually  We started to kick in now.  So I'm hoping to see that we actually gross more,  but anyhow, we are a value for value show.  And this is one of what this actually means is that,  you know, in the commercials,  the whole time we were here talking  and having the discussions that we were having.  And the reason why we don't do breaking  at the, uh, the, the player of the conversation up and, and stuff like that is because  one, if you're running a mattress, you know, to go to mattress firm or someplace like that.  You don't have to get to a, to get a mattress. You don't, we don't need to sell you a mattress  from Casper or someplace like that. We don't need to sell you a toothbrush or a razor or  or some new widget or a box of monthly subscription box of random items.  These are things that a lot of people do grow and they try to sell you.  This is just part of what a lot of people in the podcasting industrial complex,  like things that that's how you're supposed to do it.  If you want to make money, you get advertised.  Well, no, there's another way in this call value for value.  And what it basically breaks down to is how much is our show worth to you?  How much do you think what we talk about the community we bring,  bring together? How much is that worth to you?  Because a lot of people, they may say, I got a lot of value out of it.  And maybe I would, I can take a couple hours out of my day and help do chapter art.  All right. Take some time out of my day. And I can, I can work out chapters. I can  serve chapters instead of 53 different chapters. We've only need about 28. You know, we can set  you can, we offer the ability for you to help in either your time, your talent, or if you're able to  treasure and because what we're doing isn't free now we're letting the bill for the vast majority of  everything. But at the same time, if you wanted to help us to keep going, you're able to do that.  you can go to a modern podcast app like true fans or go to a podcast guru and each one of those has got a  feature that allows them to support what's called the funding tag. And when you hit the button for  the funding was support this show button or whatever you want the person calls it, but now  as it's support the show, you get redirected over to the PayPal page and you're able to  give any amount you want. It could be a dollar, it could be a thousand dollars, it could  be more. It could be on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis or just a one-time support.  the options are all yours. I hate just trying to state that there's, there's a lot of  people do little clubs and they're like, oh, and if we're selling dollars a month, you'll  get all the stuff. Well, I'm not working on it. I'll tell you. And if you think that's  worth anything, then you can, you can throw some money out direction. However, much is  all really up to you. And one of the things that we like to do here is if you got comments  questions or things like that, you can actually send that over to us and we will reply.  And you don't even actually even have to pay for it on that.  Again, we do everything that's free so that you can decide what we're valued at.  We're not requiring you to pay just $7 just to have access to the community.  get access to the community. You can, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the century is what do you think the community is worth?  And so that's how, that's how we're changing our way of doing our,  doing the show, help it try to fund the show. And that's what it's for. It's not,  so that we think we're going to get rich. We know, we're not, we're going to get rich doing  the show, but we might be able to get people to help the fund the show help paper for hosting  or if hosting starts getting too expensive, you know, we might have to go off and start  spending up our own types of servers and things like that. That's something, you know,  miles down the road. I'm not worried about that at all. But so we have different things that we  can do and you're able to provide that type of help. And so that's what I like, that's the value  value model that we use because it's a lot easier to  like cleaner and it's, you know, it's a it's a it's a  different way to where we don't have to sit there and and  probably to you with commercials that mean nothing to you.  They mean they don't have any significance in your life.  You know, you've got you just bought a new mattress and box  you don't need the cast for mattress and you don't need a you don't need a  quip toothbrush or anything like that. So there's a lot of different ways and  means that you can help and if you want to know how you can do that you can  always shoot me an email that a circle cast CIR CLE C A S T at gmail.com or  you can shoot rich in email. That's our  Chelsea and that's C H E L S O N at  gmail.com. And if you want to get a hold of  baby, hey, just send one over to us because  no one remembers how to spell his, his email address.  So let's just, we'll just send it over to us.  We'll send it over to him and we'll hear about it  the following week. So with that guys, I want to say  again, thank y'all for for listening. Thank y'all for  for contributing and helping in ways that you do. And Rich, what do you have to say?  Oh, not too much. I want to thank you, you two. Again, this, this, I, I enjoyed this podcast.

They're not evergreen where they stay the test of time. They get more important.  And so the system knows that those clips are getting hundreds of millions of views, some of them,  where I lay out and predict hundreds of subjects and what's going to happen.  Mainstream media government cover-ups.  You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas.  Alex Jones. Hello my friends.

Unless you're a globalist and you want North Korea to attack.  And so we'll talk about that in the Pentagon plan to get the psychopath  in the North Korean capital to attack us and we'll go over that. So  we go into Iraq that was no threat to America, no threat to Israel, no threat  threat to anybody  that's admitted by the government's own documents  but north korea threatens the nookas literally on a weekly basis in their  official publications  they have missiles thanks to bill clinton in the new world order  they can hit any part of the united states any city in the united states they  have murder  technology now so they can have multiple warheads at top the missiles  when they come into reentry into uh... the atmosphere  over the continental united states or the possessions  and we're not worried about that  people openly threatening to nookas you imagine if siddhana every day was  threatening the nookas  what will happen to this guy  for sure for rea is sitting on for trillion in oil and isn't the middle of  the middle east of all these other  well-producing countries around it  and north for rea is an a pushover  and so that's why they're not being invaded  but that is on the  i would say moving towards the middle burner from the back burner now to  still war going  with north for real  meanwhile we'll have israel attacking iran getting us into the middle of that  and uh... they're gonna have a national graph folks  so we'll talk about it we get back and then just so much more  huge broadcast lined up for its a day  be sure and stay with us  on your host Alex Jones and again the website's prisonplina.tv.

Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 of the take-over.  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.  The Civil Emergency was created by the police.  the police attack people on the street and just coming at like the medical fields are  going to be enormous for me.  You see them here with their hands, cut the hand, their backs.  They are being led into the sand point grid, the neighbors in that area, the sand point  naval air station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.

The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.  President Bush's plan to withdraw up to 70,000 trips from overseas bases  contained abuse specifics, particularly about Asia.  Some experts think the United States may leave much of its Asia force intact.  Though Pentagon report is discussing polling 30,000 troops out of Asia, and another 30,000  of bases in Europe, predominantly in Boygslan or in Germany. President Bush  yesterday said he wanted to move 60 to 70,000 foreign base troops back to the  United States over the next decade. The movie said would help make the US  military more flexible and would reduce costs. He gave no other details about  the plan and officials in Washington told reporters that most of the  the civics would be ironed out in the coming years in talks with U.S. allies.  It is not even clear of the figure of 70,000 includes the 12,000 soldiers at the Pentagon  said last month would be pulled out of South Korea in the next two years.  They already pulled 4,000 front line battle trips, actual combat trips off of the  the develitry zone.  We have all these top generals, members of Congress, the House and Senate, saying the draft  is needed on both sides of the aisle.  We have the draft boards being set back up.  We have selective service.  Getting its funding radically increased.  We have 12 separate pieces of legislation that have been introduced from the last two and  a half years.  for real estate national draft  three of the four services  uh... not gotten their quotas for recruitment by forty two sixty  percent depending on the service  the only service that has gotten its quotas after lowering them by the way  is the marine core because of its pre-decor  and it's history  people are still very supportive of that and they could find a lot of people  that want to join a new serve  and of course i've seen reports that the army has missed its  re-enlistman quote a trying to get folks are in list  by forty five percent as well  now that's just current troops drinks  and they went down to one hundred twenty five thousand iraq six months  together now boost that back up to one hundred and sixty five thousand  not counting the fifty thousand mercenary forces and those are actual combat  uh... forces there's another thirty thousand logistical  uh... truck drivers and technicians in the country so  we've got to all what is that two hundred  at that  two hundred forty plus thousand  uh... personnel in iraq and  a secretary of the army white who i know fan of by the way mister in ron scamer  uh... white though before the war when he got told a resign he said look up  talked all the general we run the computer maps  we're gonna need five hundred thousand eighty four hundred thousand  but five hundred is the uh... what's needed here  and they said shut up you don't know what you're talking about resigned  and there's been former heads of the marine corps and former top  well the head of the air force from the first all for his republican  has gone public on this is ridiculous this is a lot of work  but see it's not meant to work  it's meant to be a quack-mile uh... the pentagon office of p2 og  created two and a half years ago said this is public just type p2 og and  research engine  you get you p i associated press pentagon press releases  saying we want to go out and kill people in cause anger and cause more  resistance because they may get to widen the war  there's the military industrial complex the private companies are making  hundreds of billions of dollars a year  office and you think they want to stop it it's like the war on drugs  we look at the war on drugs and we say man we we we we double the drug war  funding every ten years you can look at a graph  a just department graph funding  adjust federally it it doubles every decade  and the last decade  uh... we've had triple the heroin double the co-cannar's  rich  and we've gone from one million people in prison ten years ago  two seven million  seven million and they're just building more prison can you go  well wait a minute the more we spend the more we get uh... boy the drug wars  failing i say no  if you look at the real aim of the drug war it is a resounding success  many of the private presence are linked to companies that are known drug  traffickers controlling the  two hundred fifty billion dollar year industry here in america  and then when your kid gets caught using drugs are bringing a house for  drug money they get put in the private present  and work for the drug dealers  it's quite a system they they bring in the crisis off of the solution and then  basically took over the entire economy and the very same companies that own the  private prisons and ship in the narcotics are also the companies that own the  surveillance camera systems and tracking systems that are going in under  billion dollar contracts in every major city they are the same companies that  issue the black scheme asking black armored uniforms of the police and the  the armored personnel carriers and the ground penetrating radar for the helicopters and the consulting and the training and  they're the same people that have the companies that are hiring the mercenaries for torture and oppression in the Middle East.  I mean, it's really, it's not hard to figure out.  So it's just like with the drug war. Same thing with the war on terror.  We had the World Trade Center bombing in 93 and the leave the bomb took by the FBI, the driver trained.  The informant pulled out and was told let the bombing go forward. He freaked out, recorded the FBI ordering to do this  Because he thought he was being shut up and they were trying to shut him up and that saved him. Mr. Salahm  And after that they got the anti-terror funding double. Double is always the magic term a magic number and then after Oklahoma City  They got their funding more than double slightly over double  Then after 9-11. They got their funding double and now the 9-11 commission has come out  one another thirty billion a year for a new domestic  uh... anti-terror is our  which will have the power to arrest citizens for any  terrorism or crime that's actually in the legislation terror or crime now we have  a new c i'd if i cry  and uh... there they want  roughly that will uh... be a uh...  but a twenty percent increase over the last doubling some of the other  doubling  and uh... so it's the same thing and you're gonna see more care i mean look at  the graph does the funding and graces of the terror and graces  as the anti drug funding and graces the anti drug funding and the uh...  the uh... the uh... drugs increase  and it's the same thing with the uh... not that we've now got the policy reports  were the at the almost meant to be a  police action  to go on for the decade  to be lost  to create a counter revolution here in america to bulk and i's the nation  and uh... they made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions  of dollars off of it during the war  if we would have gone in there in five weeks in the military had programs  and sent tank divisions up the road and smashed  uh... the north and taken over with we would have been in full control  mister  uh... stop military at that time  but uh... never happened in five weeks  uh... no  it never did because it wasn't meant to happen it was meant to be a cash  machine  and so now the same thing and i reckon p2o g states that  uh... that this is meant to go on forever and then to use our records of base to  go into all the surrounding countries  and our troops are going to leave your up and they're going to go into the  Middle East  and when our troops start leaving  uh... the Korean peninsula  well you can guess what's going to happen there and then we're gonna have  a national draft  and it's off to the races in world war three  which the global is actually now want to have  uh... with uh... nuclear states like no three of you will then launch a  missile hit the u.s. we've only got a couple  and the global is for love to have a couple smoldering cities  they could set up police state here domestically  uh... while then going in and taking over north or read  and don't think they won't do it folks because this is the program this is the  plan again in their own policy reports  whether it's p-nack or bresinski in the trial out of the commission it's all  public it isn't even hidden  but they know that ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of people  do not sit around until four in the morning reading p-nack documents like i did  they know you don't sit around reading bresig and bresinski's book for  branch out sport they know you don't do any of that  you get home at six thirty you cook dinner for the children  maybe a second little league baseball  they spent all day being brainwashed by the government  uh... you can you get home and not a clock at night  pop in a dvd watching action thriller  the kids are in the other room playing video games almost all of them were  you simulate being you and rich killing americans  they're being brainwashed in the other end of spending time with them because  your exhausted i don't blame you  and then you go to bed you get up tomorrow and don't even know how your government works locally  much less nationally or internationally maybe you watch ten minutes of  fox and  here house someone's liberal there is the war and especially with such a  paradigm  but uh...  really  the wrinkle in their argument for giving up our liberties for so-called  security is history you give up liberty you get to your needs i love to say  because it's true  that's my mantra  their mantra is give up liberty you get security it's a fraud it's a  lot it's gotta be counted  uh... but they claim that giving up our freedoms will make a save will  why the borders more open than ever  uh... why did you go after sedom who you put in power who you told to attack  iran who you told to attack  you go ahead and attack  uh...  polite  you know why didn't you assassinate why did you do this you know what why did  you put him in power  and  we're not worried about uh... him jung ill in north korea friend nucus on a weekly  basis  that our government help arm of nuclear reactors rums welled on the board of  a bb that made the transfer we are both hunting to trade which is both  hunting  this degree with the republican owners of these companies ship the weapons  as the rubber stamper  that's why republicans never really went after clinton on china gate nuclear  gait and all those gates  because he was just a client following orders  i mean it's like halleberg and it may be as a giant off-source of ciri  that does most of the business with iran  our government has sanctions on iran  and then only halleberg allowed to deal with iran because of the special  loophole they designed in law  but like for the twelve years of the sanctions against the government submitted  the one u.s. company that could be business with halleberg and they had a  loophole the bill clinton  did you know that's public  mean how sick is that  how sick is that  they tell us that there's this big threat  we had to go in and get some down but meanwhile or three of  is starting to do this on weekly basis  with weapons systems that we gave shine in the day gave to more threea  that our government gave back to them that they gave more threea  and now we're pulling groups out of there to go to iraq  already pulled out four thousand  We're going to pull out 15,000 more.  Some say 30,000 more.  From the real threat, the ghost of the oil.  Now, who are the traders here?  Where are they right by?  Our terrorist cells are prime terror targets located near you.

Thank you for joining us  So not only do we have now the announcement of 70,000 trips to be pulled out of Asia Europe and other areas  But there's no troops or is it folks?  We also have articles like this every day.  57-year-old veteran called for duty.  I see articles for this, say, 63-year-old veteran.  He's a 57-year-old afflicted with skin cancer,  partially deaf, and suffer from high blood pressure.  But the US Army still wants  master sergeant, Lewis, Jamie, for Vimeo.  On July 14, the Vietnam and Desert Storm veteran  received his third order to report active duty,  mobilize for operation i read freedom  i was very shocked vino said a member of the  army's individual ready to deserve i are  and not part of a reserve unit  do not get paid and do not attend monthly reserve training however because of  critical skills  they possess they can be recalled  the duty of needed  and this belief he called the army hotline listed  on his orders am i reading this thing right  at my age still want me to ask  But there was no mistake, Covino is the report to a mobilization unit, September 15th, and  Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  If I did not execute these orders, I will go to jail.  He said, Covino, a Rio Grande City NATO, served in the US Air Force during the Vietnam  War, and then joined the Army Reserve in 72, the former middle school teacher also served  during Desert Storm in 91.  And though Covino was willing to serve again, he wonders why the military wants him.  So this guy has served in two wars and been in the guard after that and that's what the  stock gap measures are doing.  You serve for five, 10, 15, 20 years and then you go, all right, I'm leaving.  I'm going to go start a business, spend time with my family.  Oh, sorry, you've got to stay another year and then the year passes.  Oh, you've got to stay another year.  that's a draft of the worst group imaginable they've already served  i mean even in world war two you just served uh... eleven months  and then you got out after your turn of duty  but not in the unknown you only have to go for a tour  but this new special proud is of those of our any sir those of our deep  it's amazing and every day  well there was one day a couple weeks ago i had like five articles about  fifty five sixty three-year-old people  uh... in a with her needs and and  and p  and  and pull trips out of Europe, I don't really care about Europe, for the Middle East,  where we put liberated everyone.  So how was Saddam a greater threat than Kim Jong-il who openly threatens the nucleus?  And then I've got other stories like this one.  Private property may become preserved.  Now all over the country, they're passing these, where, here in Austin, in about half  city  you can only build on about twenty to twenty five percent of your property and it  totally ruins people's property i mean if you've got an acre you can build a little  shock on  and then they force you to sell to the city to make a restrictions often  turned into a golf course  or uh... shopping mall hotel and pay for price  residents of king county washroom will only be able to build on ten percent  of their land  they didn't have that so the union according to a new wall being considered  of the county government which in acted will be the most restrictive land use law  in the nation  and uh... known as the sixty five ten rule it calls for land owners a set  aside fifty five percent of their own property  and keep it in the national vegetative state  or to the rule nothing can be built on the land  and of a tree can't be cut down for example it must be replanted  building anything is out of the question  and it gets into the actual reading of the of the losses that only ten  the land to be built on  and i've got the official federal match over half the country we're not even  gonna be allowed into  and uh... you we you already be told roads they build on interstates  they just walk all the old edges to small towns a small you just drive by  ghost town of for ghost town especially in Kansas  you might drive fifty sixty miles where you're you cannot exit  the McDonald's and gas stations are built in the middle of the road in the  government that's money on public  the whole country's going to be like this is the official plan and uh...  is  you're wondering how they're going to get you out of the rural areas of this  gonna kill your economy  and i know you don't believe it'll happen  here in Austin they're gonna build  not nine now but fifteen  poll roads every major street  uh... on the existing roads so it's all part of the freedom  we're on the march  the empires on the run  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

there's a lot of news what i'm glad news to cover  what's up with  absolutely amazing okay  the uh... free credit agreement between australian the united states  uh...  it's actually  have gone through one uh... august uh... which is the blackest day in the  history  or australia and the united states  which actually takes away our sovereignty  because what happened is a lot of the uh... negotiations and uh...  war part of the gosh for companies will not be handled by parliament anymore  it will be handled by a body that will be elected uh... by  companies  now for those who don't understand there's a big trade deal  uh... and again the european union started as the economic community  they don't tell you work  creating world government they say oh it's a trade deal  and they've heard the social security the law enforcement  the welfare system the laws  and that's why sixty thousand people protested  and ninety nine in Seattle  liberals conservatives  because we were giving up our forty the world trade organization  also same thing with this agreement literally corporations create their own  board  that is above our government go ahead  absolutely right uh... the government have not said all  also what uh... they have to do the government do you know the forty agreement  to go through  they have to amend existing laws that was that was a mandate  and that was actually mandated by the w uh...  to help  uh...  they had to amend a lot of laws are copyright laws  uh... crime laws and the w we are only is only nine years old folks and already  runs the plan  absolutely  and also uh... along with that  we have those are general of a degree of uh... agreements on terrorism trade  and then now they have  uh... the free trade area of america's which they admit is the pound american union  that's right also what they're doing is they're going to use uh... the austral  pre-fair agreement  as a standard for the american so what that means is  the last time that i thought you were talking about the borders in uh... in  maksa car  that's going to be only a minor problem for you because once they do a  would america's the america's chilli and so forth uh... a lot of those people will  be able to come to the united states work  or cheaper wages now you're building a super high-way it's done from  counted in the maxa color building in the maxa car  and that's bushes and the st plan is total  complete anybody who wants to come here or who can get here is automatically legal  for six years  and the government is going to pay to bring more  unskilled labor here  and they say the layoffs in high tech  are gonna get seven times more severe  and bush in january of the shear said quote  this is our number one export is jobs we need to accelerate  absolutely now some of the things that are coming is  tech start clothing accessories fair parts and tools  uh... after cultural uh... victory chemicals  amendment the amendments to the one and brandy  uh... industry life insurance for neck positions  and take office uh... come all the parties and companies  and therapeutic goods uh... patent amendments  copyright  because what would have spectrum  it's amazing and  it's world government  we have the e you are emerging with the pan-American union and a  konnadian deal earlier this year and people don't even know what the e u were  the pan-American union is  or what the wt oh is  and just like congress came up to the authority over the wt oh and trade  uh... now they're gonna give up their authority to this tears are over internal  security  yes what an actual fact uh... the comments uh...  with the feet trade deals  don't have authority congress  uh... or else on it or whatever now recent  high court decision because of the free trade agreement  have to be made  uh...  in order for them to uh...  hold you  the government can hold you legally  in detention now without uh... any access to a lawyer  or  editing else really  chasse  lulian europe student same thing our courts for doing the same thing  yes it's great work comes out as they can secretly grab you and hold you  but you should be able to complain to a higher authority in the camp  and they were ooh  a victory for freedom  you can complain to the commandant of the camp  but also it covers the uh... report is too because what happens is a  for example  a reporter like you may or whoever we want to do a story on uh... terrorist  acts or whatever  uh... the guy could be associated with uh... terrorist organization  the reporter will be helped  charged an imprisoned  associated  now uh... last year  a a a a a uh...  professor at a college  and one of his students sent an email to the government  about  i think was the wt o meeting i have the article  on the website  and he was arrested because quote influencing government was an improper  use of his telephone to just into text message email  uh... sure you're familiar with that story  yes i am familiar with so so this is your freedom in australia is you can't  email the government it's not threatening but still it's it's it's  wrong the influence of the government  yet but not only in australia near not a state this is this is bad for  but i don't know if it's just to see australia that was a pretty free  country just a few decades ago  as to ten years ago to be losing all of your freedoms is so sad  well i think what's really amazing another blackest day in australian history  and yet not one single paper  or otherwise  talk  talk host  even coming to the back  well that's how they like  they lied by a mission  and they don't uh... the average person again  and but the average american doesn't know how many continents there are  they can't name five state capitals they can't tell you who the second  president was  they can't tell you what the fourth amendment is but they got their opinion  about politics though  and i guess it sounds like it's the same thing in australia because the news  doesn't ever report on this stuff so people just aren't aware  now i was doing my show and uh... i was going right through this and i had some  guests on and so forth uh... and i put some of my website which uh... by the way  you feature on there  you got your own page  well thank you  hahaha so bright  my pleasure i think you're a good guy you're doing it well  uh... and you know a lot of people are in here said  kid what are you talking about  what will we were a sovereign country you know we're in the country  i said not anymore and then uh...  uh... going up and uh... because i do show  twice a week sometimes  and i think i don't believe what you said what i said what i talk about is  document it  i don't care you know just doctor tommy he didn't say boys two weeks ago  there with your leader announcing all this  uh... no i saw bush uh... signing the free trade agreement he signed it and said  done. Now, please, thank you very much. Goodbye and there goes your freedoms, which is  United States and also Australia. But particularly one, one, I guided this guess or  the ball I had to the website of the Senate. He came back a couple days later and he said,  sorry, I believe everything you're saying, because he read for himself. And that's all  people have to do just got to be studying  well that's a little bit of a bit of a balance  that's really the power we have is that we can point people to the source  documents the problem is most people aren't like that guy  he'll just deny what you're saying and won't go check it out and won't  take your challenge if people would  take us up on the challenge of checking it out themselves we would turn things  around  but this process is happening there isn't awakening here  are you seeing any type of awakening in australia are people still in the  dark because of the media block out  well there's uh... there's a lot of people that i do know like you that are  like into it and not trying to do something about it  but you know i would say probably about it is the percent of the population are  asleep  and i think they just  well we've got our our work cut out for a stand i appreciate your call  there goes dead folks broadcast for it  on the largest cities in australia we appreciate uh... his work  teeth and florida teeth are on the air go ahead  Yeah, thank you for having me with all time and we'll call to it.  Well, I was just down a day for it to be toward it.  And we talked to the issue about people being prepared,  like the environmental disasters and stuff.  Yes.  And I think they have a birthday light and I think  all that.  It turned to be very quick.  While I was there, I did go for the vacation.  We were looking for someone.  And they were in a bad neighborhood.  But why?  I've been estranged for about 10 years.  That's not what I call.  there were derelict everywhere  people were through  uh... i was in a record of our  you know better not to park his car purchase  you know that i would have been  you know that i was carrying  also trying to get at it  what happens like a situation for the  where they can't do back no check for people were by firearms  because he could be too much for them to contact the state of forty the  handle it  what do they do  uh... they can't do back no check  what is the law  no i'm on on following part of what you're saying uh... look we need to go  back to the vermont style uh... law where  i agree  where where there's no controls  because criminals are going to get guns to begin with and it's only law  buying people who are restricted  all right i'll tell you  when they passed the kachil karaon florida your crime right within two years  drop twenty  five percent  right in the uh... violent crime right  uh... all those uh... uh... tourists were getting car jack all the problems now the  croaks aren't doing that like they were  because it's it's playing russian roulette they try to carjack the wrong car  you know when five percent of people are carrying firearms legally  uh... it's over for them  and so the you know that's the answer more guns less crime more guns more  freedom  we have a really great and uh...  but uh... you know what i'm saying uh...  those people you know what  it's kind of sad it's nice for us in community  and I think people were a drone through.  They were about to be social and they were on chairs  and you had to ask grills, cook and food,  you know, to know so power and stuff.  It's up like that and, and, and, and,  and when I drove it to the back of the room,  which where I had to go,  I guess that it was just people all over the place  and cops were like truckers, shoulders and me.  I didn't want any mask and drugs.  I have an article here about that.  It says thieves plunder the state  and aftermath and its poons of gourda  Out of the hurricane ended the looting began among the first targets official said was the Charlotte Harbor fire department. I'm in  Fire firefighters arrived early Saturday to find their computers had been swiped in the night Charlotte County Sheriff's Office  spokesman Robert  Carpenter said his office is getting regular reports of looting or residents of the areas many storm wrecked neighborhoods man folks 40 years ago  it things changed. I mean in the past, a hurricane hit, no one would lose. What happened  to Americans? We became evil and we got an evil guy. You know, that just goes hand in hand.  It's a symbiotic relationship. And then I've got another article here out of the associated  press. Officials reluctant to release death toll and they're keeping it very secret to  how many people have died. And I heard that not many people died. So I was like, oh, this  is good news, but now it looks like there's been a whole bunch of deaths. Do you have  out here how many people have died  i know i think i'm talking about back in what andrew  uh... what we know that  uh... hundreds died in the cover that up in andrew no in the near the new  uh... this is a new article  about charlie  carl i  it what i saw in the carla was  that there are a lot of structural damage  there was a lot of debris damage like trees uprooted  power lines for down  uh...  cars that know that you know a lot of a lot of satellite system down  that i think i don't know that other areas of the story  and that were a part by her  if what i saw a day kona  that i think that i had a great four  category four really is  i mean they must be devastated  i mean i thought  convoy after con boy from george uh...  legan alabama  about the power company  which is filed on  miles of them i mean  it  really bad  what is about what is about nice places to live in California got her  place you got her canes and florida  god bless all those poor people  yeah i think you thank you for the call he'd i appreciate it  barney and marin will another year up next we get back  one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one  we got job  uh... uh... uh... son of larry pratt joining us  about forty minutes so you know what miss that as well stay with us  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film,  Least Day 3 Total Encement.

Well so does he  He's Alex Jones  A Magician Radio Network  And now  Live from Austin, Texas  Alex Jones  Alright my friends thank you for joining us  Through justice the American way  Standing up against tyranny  Defending liberty  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central back from 9 to 9. We'll go back to your  call turns to 2nd, but police want you to pay for their wiretaps. Now we already  have a surcharge in telecommunications for this here, but Canada is getting on board  to some of the globe and mail. Canada's police chiefs propose a surcharge of about 25  cents on monthly telephone and internet bills to cover the cost of tapping into the  communications of terrorists and other criminals.  See big random snooping.  Let's see, it's always terrorists and criminals.  Terrorists and crime.  Terrorists and criminals.  Terrorists and other crimes.  Other suspected crimes.  It's the same thing.  Over and over and over and over.  The front drivers are all being trained.  Look for terrorists and others suspicious criminal activity.  Everyone is being recruited, the exterminator, the phone man, the cable guy, the carpet  cleaner look for terror america's under attack terror but  got a percent of this course you're about to take and you're gonna be paid to  take  will be how to look for criminals  well go to will stop criminals oh sure we will  uh... turning america into east germany folks i can't believe this but it's  really happening  war news on the national i'd be carter i want to get to do but  i'm going back to the end of the  july and uh... ryan and telling others  dandy  uh... down the  down the  to get a safety deposit box one place  yes uh... out of the simple work and uh... now the first bank i went to  was a it is a small local uh... state charter bank  and uh... for stay indicated to me  i could not rent the safe deposit box without having an account  and of course open account must provide them so security number  I left that bank and went to the next bank down the street, which is among one of the larger  bank tanks in the nation.  And again, one inside asked the lady, did they have any safe deposit boxes available?  They showed me the various different sizes of the box.  As I indicated the one size that would be appropriate for money, then I asked her.  I said, do I have to have an account here to rent one of these boxes?  I said, well, if I have to rent one of these boxes, well, I have to give you my social  security numbers.  He said, yes, sir.  And I said, but ma'am, I'm not here to apply for social security benefits, nor am I here  to pay my taxes.  And she says, well, but we can't do that.  We can't rent you this box without social security number.  And I said, why?  she said because the pay for it act requires  uh...  do you have internet access i sure do i'm signed on i'm among your  uh... annual subscribers prison planet david well thank you for the support  that's absolutely vital down to the alics i'm on tag of the truth uh...  the don't you know don't get this in the butt to bad but uh... in my opinion  you're not charging enough  hahaha well no it's just enough so we can continue all the website cuz a  bandwith cost work where victims of our own success  i'm not really glad to have more than glad to be a subscriber  well thank you will have fifty cents a day people get the two books that i've  written and paul's written  uh... the weekly t-v report the audio reports the tax reports and a bunch of  other films all my videos but  the reason i mentioned the internet is  just type into a major search engine  hatred act compliance  last time i did it over a hundred and ten thousand links popped up  pizza change  grocery stores  banks  uh...  everything  everything is patreon compliance everything you do everything you buy  everything you sell it with the chain or a big business  uh... is control  and this is going to plug into the new national sales tax at the fake  conservatives  or pushing it'll go alongside the income tax  and then that'll bring federal control in every business  uh... but but yes sir and then these politicians get up on tv and say  you show me one example of words being used again in an on-terrication  and then no one's their challenge is they go see  the books every two days  well i just called report my personal example  every two days i see at least one article and i'm not looking for them  but every couple days where a pot dealer  uh... somebody gets an argument with their wife their punching each other they  get charged with it  uh... somebody overseas that all orders are charged with it  uh... again  uh... been rigging county commissioner people charging too much for concrete  and bids  uh... just  it's  i've got  i've probably seen conservatively fifty articles last two years  for state and county prosecutors say  oh i'm using it all it's wonderful  i have the testimony two years ago  uh... where the head spokesman for the just department told congress of course  we use it  and not a related cases  this is congressional testimony but still neo-cons all over ready  on TV lie and say it's not being used in the liberals only use examples of  Muslims out on their rights violated that then makes it some type of weird racial  debate and i don't think the average person knows how serious this is  well it's bad Alec and of course i would use to the the player for running the  bot uh i will not comply with the  error errors uh root and blue ones that you know that's sad i've been thinking  I want to say to deposit boxes to put deeds and documents and maybe a little bit of  gold in.  Yep.  And you know what?  It's not safe.  All the time now, the IRS, no jury, no judge, you're not charged.  Now how does this happen?  No due process folks.  They just take your bank account.

I mean, I'm post.  both of them ended our constitution by phi  uh... no man uh... has a right not be deprived of his uh... property without  due process it's not a privilege  and if they want to  the nine euro privilege they're afraid to do so  and then i can't even call a carpet cleaner or a terminator  without knowing and i don't know how  but but the point is it's my house my castle i shouldn't be paying somebody  for a service while they're spying on me.

major cities they're pre-deployed home these with  huge microwave guns modern the top eighty-seven  years ago  uh... let's talk to brian and virginia beach go ahead sir  yes i think that mccall you bet  well i i get the couple things i want to address uh... mainly the area of  technology  uh...  my back one of course is an engineer in an aeronautics  and uh... i noticed i became a cross-maintenance and  marty uh... twenty  or sixty thousand two a patent that  uh... zero energy device  it's for energy for anybody  it's not allowed  in this country  and i want to know if you had heard anything about more if it was  that there's a little bit of some of the old  no more fun physics  uh... as far as the uh... the uh... the devices concerns the term  they're done  and i don't know if you've heard of him before i have interviewed  the people who back in the eighties claim that they had developed these devices  uh... and i'm not an engineer uh... but i have interviewed a lot of engineers and  they do have  uh... these technologies  the problem is is extracting the power  uh... but that can be done very quickly  i have developed those into usable forms  commercially  viable forms and there's a lot of technology that's been suppressed i mean a  good example of this is  eight years ago they had light bulbs at last in five years  fifty years ago they had panty hoes that would last for a year  hundreds of wherens  instead they will last  made he wants he can ask my wife about that  everything they just did it so so  at everything it's called planned  obsolescence  but more of the planned obsolescence they are  they've suppressed our technological development at a frozen level  all the elite has built a parallel  highly advanced technology above us  yeah and that's what the new world order is about and i finally found a  bunch publications admitted this  even though i instinctively knew it but that they go  uh... now i found this  just we've got a little bit documents on the subject  that's why they want to world government so they can done us down  start reducing our population numbers through uh... one child policies and  vaccines the rest of it  so the elite has access all this and we don't  well absolutely  and it's a little more than that  i mean i've been following uh...  russian technology  for  some years now  and uh... even for me to stop the american  but about either the super cavitation for people who are what's more scary  is a fit generation aircraft  and i've always scrambling to find figure out  how they did it because the entire trial and pilot  the navy  they said uh...  we expect only a uh... seven second  uh... what's expected to get to have nothing that can go in  but understand that's our pilots in thirty-year-old technology that don't know  about all the advanced technology that the government has to know that we  don't know how the Russians did it  that's because the Russians are developing things that we developed twenty-five  thirty years ago  and are now rolling these out new which new but it's really not new  it probably  you're probably right but you are pilots aren't gonna be part of that those  are all gonna be a real body  The black man is the auroras.

Anti-y's trying to rescue the semi-auto band from Death Row.  I guess that's probably one of the most important things  in the legislative update section of gunowners.org.  uh... arrick but a first off it's good to have you on with us  a thank you so much Alex great to be with you  you bet uh...  first off for those that may not know you are we all love your father and  appreciate his friend work it down on earth but  tells a little bit about iraq pratt what you do a gun owners  well i tell you it's tough shoes to uh... walk in uh...  uh... walking in his shoes but uh... the director of communications a gun owners  and uh... been with the organization for over ten years do a lot of the media  and of course uh... really enjoy this is a real heartfelt issue  uh... for me as well as my father's uh... you know this has been an issue that  has been near and dear to us for many many years  well it's good to see a son following his father's footsteps kind of the old  fashion thing that i can't think of a more important issue than being armed  slaves are disarmed folks it it it really boiled down to that when you cut  through all the garbage  uh... eric let's get into legislative updates  a lot of stuff happening right now with the second amendment a lot of  traitorous republicans working with the democrats at the state federal  level uh... we've had uh... whole neighborhoods with their guns being  confiscated  uh... up in uh...  Oshkosh was constant we've got  go down the  line for us of some of the most egregious threats to our second amendment  right now  well certainly you mentioned the Oshkosh situation where because of a shooting  uh... they cordoned off a whole section or third town uh... part of the town and  just went door to door confiscating firearms to see if they match the  the ballistics are just simply outrageous invasions of privacy  uh... at the federal level  uh... we have this ban which uh... thankfully  uh... we will probably see sunset on september fourteen  now that doesn't mean that the uh... that the battle is by any means over  uh... senator dian fine sign who was one of the primary authors of this band  uh... has been chomping at the bits and is looking for all kinds of opportunities to  offer  an amendment  that would reauthorize the band and probably most of people out so from  familiar with with the details of this but  uh... in case there's anybody who's not  in order for fine sign to get enough support in nineteen ninety four when she  initially proposed this man she stuck a sunset in  uh... quite frankly i think that's a great idea for all legislation they should have  a sunset and there's a hey let's look at this legislation after five or ten  years and see if it's really working  uh... i think most legislation we would just rather say uh... let's just let it  die  well she stuck this uh... sunset in for ten years and so here we are on the  verge  of the uh... the tenth year at the twelve hour  on september thirteen th this ban is gonna some sunset and she and others  like her fighting furiously to try to get it reenacted reauthorized and she's been  trying to throw it as an amendment onto must pass bills on the spending bills  on on you name it and so far we've been very effective thank god at beating her  back on that and and preventing that from happening and I tell you it's been  through a lot of grassroots efforts that this has happened we we fought a  battle on this in March and unfortunately Senator Frist, the majority leader, did absolutely  nothing to keep her from offering the amendment. And obviously as the majority leader,  there's all kinds of parliamentary moves that he could have used. He simply refused to  do it. Well, we hit him real hard. I had a lot of people emailing him, calling him, faxing  him. When the next go around came around this summer, he had finally seen the light a  little bit and he uh... when they brought up a class action lawsuit bill  uh... we were much interested in other than the fact that diana and fine sign wanted  to offer her amendment to that bill  and uh... that's when we hit him pretty hard and uh... he finally did the right  thing and he uh... gerrymandered to the bill in such a way with parliament  to lose that actually prevented her from offering that amendment so we were  very glad to see that  now that shows  republicans time and time again try to work with the democrats and  treacherous  bashions do this  but it does show that still  say you're republican you're supposed to be conservative  you know that eighty seven percent of program candidates were elected  reelected  in the last two elections  uh... you guys better watch  because we'll just give you the democrats if you don't back off  that is still having a fact and those phone calls really do count  unfortunately the alright  has been kind of passively fighting this only gun owners and jpfo have been doing  uh... decent jobs and obviously jp f uh... always in his biggest gun owners doesn't have a cloud  uh... all the members but  this is part of a pattern  uh... number one bush is said i have a whole file on this of mainstream news  that he will reauthorize that sucker  if it hits his debt so don't think bush is gonna save you folks  uh... also  and and and and and please give us a caveat to that air can be seen here in a  second but then i want to get into the the uh...  federal case there in d c earlier this year where the n r a  uh... lawyers said we are for registering guns and not leaving the house with  and they go well that's just for d c but the point is that would set another  precedent  we have the n r a all over the place we've been catching up  uh... actually uh... supporting bills that would restrict the second amendment  i don't know you don't want to do a bashing fest here  but we really have to  uh... go down the line we know where is bush now under all the pressure we put  on him  if he does get this bill  uh... if somehow it gets slipped in  and then examples of what the n r is up to eric  well you're absolutely right last year uh... through two different  but presidential spokesman uh... bush indicated that he would sign  the semi-auto-benefit came to him and of course that's very concerning to us i  I think not only was it the wrong thing to say constitutionally but even politically and  pragmatically it was a stupid thing for a republican to say I mean after all this is the  piece of legislation that president Clinton has admitted on numerous occasions and by the  way this is an admission against interest so this may be one of the few truthful things former  president Clinton said that he said it was this ban that he signed into law that caused him  control the congress in nineteen ninety four years repeated that over and over  again good morning america recently in his book uh... you know this is  something that that is really stuck with him in and so i find it very ironic and  and almost politically suicidal  that uh... a republican president and what would have come out and said oh yeah  that bandial all sign it if it uh... if it lands on my desk now  if there's good news in a silver lining in this i think uh... since then we've  applied a lot of heat through the grassroots  uh... to the white house and people have grabbed his spokesman figuratively  speaking and really lectured them up and down and and uh... they've really  felt the sting i don't know your dad told a story of a member actually uh... grabbing  kroll robo by the arm exactly exactly  i don't body  yet so figuratively and literally  and i i think what we have gotten from that is i i i i'd unfortunately i don't  think we have a change in the white house position however they have backed off  to the point where they are not at all pushing it  and i think that's one reason why it hasn't gone anywhere only had something  to this and get your strategy on it because you're more in the game than i am and i  try to stay in it but it changes by the middle second  bush was against arming the pilots  right that infuriated everybody it didn't make any sense right  uh... and so then he goes okay if you can jump through ten hoops right  uh... will do a test arms you percent of you and that never really happened  and we've got bush saying oh can't find it for four more don't worry bush won't  sign it bush signs it  don't worry the supreme court won't uphold it the republican court they have  hold it  i mean this is why i don't support bush because time after time  he does this  and it's it's it's part of a larger pattern and  i wanted to get your take on  uh... the take what sheriff mack did with you guys back in the nineties  he said no it's a ten-minute violation i'm not going to be back ground checks  on people to  by firearms  so that law was not constitutional but we still have  uh... the background check now an instant registration check  so larry taking those two points  maybe it's that i've heard some discussion that  it may allow  but the police are still just going to enforce it  well what what you had with the max situation was the part a of the  braidy law which uh... during the waiting period  uh... during that initial five years there was a waiting period  and the state police or local police were required to run the background checks.  And it was that part of it that was found unconstitutional.  Because now what you have is you have this system which unfortunately, you know, piece  by piece, nicks.  Yeah, yeah, one brick upon another.  First you had registration through gun dealers.  And now you have the gun dealers phoned it into the FBI.  So really it's bypassing in many cases the state police.  so there's no longer that that argument that they're being required by the federal  government that is the state police are being required by the feds to perform this  unconstitutional check and there are some that that's still doing they just  don't care but in most cases you just have the the federally licensed dealers  contacting the FBI so they've they've done the end around the police so  claiming is not a registration no it registers you as the gun owner but you are  absolutely correct that's right but but i mean you get my point though  is what type of event if it is repealed  uh... come up  uh... you know September 13  uh... i don't expect the gun grabbers at the federal state level to stop i mean i  i think i'm just gonna continue doing it saying well it's not a law but  you're you're well you're absolutely right and and what you will probably find  is that at the state level  uh... you'll see a lot of the legislators next year  uh... try to pass laws banning of these types of semi automatic firearms  certainly at the federal level they will continue  uh... fine signs not gonna go away she says it if we lose on this today we will be  back tomorrow and then be back the next day  uh... so they're gonna continue hammering this uh... this is an issue that's not  gonna go  of course she has our bodyguard to the king of well there's the irony in fact all  these guys really live in some you know some of the most secure sections of  washington d c there's more cops per capita  around capital hill  uh... certainly anywhere in d c let alone the uh... the rest of the country so  they passed these laws in the comfort and security of their little uh...  uh... well it's like rosio donald yonder a little cocoon  they have donald got people with machine guns but we can't have guns  that's right  that's right by the way you know it's interesting you you named off the three  issues that really have gun owners on edge  uh... the semi-auto ban  also that incumbent protection legislation the so-called campaign finance  reform  and uh... and of course the other one is is the arm pilots issue and and those three  issues uh... bush has certainly been wrong on  and i tell you you know that not only has he been wrong  constitutionally in all three of those issues but  but politically speaking you know we're all told arrick that they do what they  do to get elected and that's a bunch of bull  we've got  eighty seven percent of americans just like with the ganesh you against the  open borders  but the but the democrats republicans are trying to get rid of the  borders i mean it's just  they have a elite policy that they want to carry out  that's right and you know for bush what he's gonna find is that a lot of these  gun owners that crossed over a lot of the democrat gun owners  who voted uh... didn't vote for gore in two thousand in the ones who crossed  over in nineteen ninety four which clinton has lamented for the last ten years  uh... that they would rather stay home and vote  uh... democrat and if there's no wish note no difference on the gun issue  they were just as soon stay home and vote democrat rather than crossover and  vote for republican and so  he's really shot himself on the foot in this and on the gun issue carry in bush  in many ways uh...  a lot of people don't see a big difference  well the gun issue is paramount for me and uh...  we get back at a bunch of callers here will probably on multiple issues but  will all tie back to this  you know not just those three issues you mentioned the way right  or that i mentioned that you elaborate it on uh... your father wrote frankly  what i think is the most detailed analysis of patreon act to  he found stuff i didn't find with your lawyers  and uh... you know that's an anti gun piece of legislation in itself  and again there you have it i just it's i wish we could have a real republican  president  and uh... not to this guy  well i wish that to and i don't know if uh... one could really get elected  unfortunately  uh... but you're absolutely right uh... in many of these ways  uh... many of the issues were talking about that there there's not much of a  difference uh... you know certainly i mean kerry is awful  uh... you look at his voting record he's one of the most anti gun  but i'll send it to carry it selected you guys are going to get more money  more support and be able to fight and conservatives will be more white  with bush and office it's sleepy time  well people do think that went when there's a republican congress republican  president hey we've died in gone to heaven and you're right people do fall asleep  a little bit not realizing that some of our most intense battles have come under  republican administration  yeah so  look either way i i don't want to get elected folks but it doesn't even  frankly matter and i think overall  if carry is elected you're gonna see a bigger awakening in this country  fortunately is gonna use a victory act against us  so get ready for that  will be right back we're talking to Eric Pratt your calls are straight ahead  right here on

They're bought and paid for, they're Trojan horse, they're controlled.  Eric Pratt won't say that, I'll say that.  Dun owners is no compromise, that's why I support them.  i know the callers of the whole things before eric out here so just  try to make it for the squeak somehow on topic  but it's all interconnected but i don't want to get into the patreon  the colleges being turned into schools of tyranny in the next hour with a  but uh...  and and go over this claim to the patreon act as an effect citizens when it  does every day every one of us  uh... but uh... we were talking to brine and virginia b to be talking about  technologies in advance technologies in the military  uh... and then just go ahead brine and then you're saying  uh...  thank you  i don't mean to help  well i was also looking into the uh... uh... scc following the different companies  and  uh... but really interesting the so far as they are  the rain corporation  makes a lot of technology goes into  and people at the distance talking that or the watch from one track society  that was made up  they're not  uh... part of what they say i  you're using the watchtower track society  owns with a lot of stock in a weapons contractor  please email me that i love to see that thanks for the call  but tips and info war stock com  uh... eric that leads me to another point we have the government deploying  humvies with microwave guns here in the u.s  we have  all this so-called less than lethal or non-lethal weapons  we have the government gearing up against the people at a time they're trying  to get our guns  isn't it more important now than ever that we'd be armed as a counterbalance  against her any  well absolutely and you know we we have so far gotten away from the vision that  the founding fathers had that the way you secure peace in a country  uh... is a that the people remain armed and be i mean they they thought that  the greatest threat to liberty work was large standing armies and yet we have  them uh... you know not only at the federal level we have them in in federal  police we have them really in police in every state in every county and they  would really be abhorred at that idea and shocked that we had so given up on  our self-government and really just turned over the whole issue of protection  over to paid government agents rather than really exercising self-government  and self-responsibility. Well now Eric we have General  ever heart that had a north comp general frank's out going out of  sitcom going  well it's sad to say but for security we may have to have martial law and  set aside the constitution and  have martial law  i mean they're really floating these ideas really gearing up for it it's hard  to believe but it's  really happening  and that's outrageous uh... that that there's no provision uh... in the  constitution for uh... for saying that the constitution aside  and uh... that's just simply outrageous and and uh... you're right i think  they they float these ideas to slowly get people conditioned to the the thought  of it and i tell you that's something that we should really react against  and i thought the military sworn up to protect and defend the  constitution but  you posted on your site you guys have written about it  you know the f bi training fliers saying report dot owners report people that  quote  make frequent references to the u.s. constitution  uh... i mean what is wrong with these people  Well, you know, it's a problem that we not only face here. I mean, we face this, you know, all over the world and that is how do you protect peace  and give government the power to do it without giving it too much so that then it becomes the monster and  The founding fathers saw that the best way you did that is you kept short tabs on it if you even needed standing troops  you would only do it for two years and then you would have to ask the question  again should we continue keeping these standing troops in that hole you know if  a founding father were to appear today and say these ideas they would be  considered to be on the far right end of the spectrum you know that those ideas  have been totally lost unfortunately well look at the Swiss they don't even have  a military it's the citizens and they never get invited now the highest standard  of living in the lowest crime right in Europe that's actually the vision I  I think that most closely resembles what the founding fathers had absolutely.

One look in the mirror and we know our country  is entering a high-tech police state.  Here's just a sample from my documentary film,  Police State to the takeover.  In downtown Seattle today, the first amendment ended.  The civil emergency was created by the police.  I am pleased to have people on the street in the tournament late.  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.  You see them here with their hands, come behind their backs.  They are being led into the sand point bridge.

It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.  Yeah, just a side note for Austin listeners  this evening at  530  At 1143 North Western Street to stop East 11th  We're gonna be there for one of these board meetings which it's just good to let them know that we're aware of what they're doing and and their own admission that  It'll be restricting free speech and so we want to come down that's important the real fights are coming at the City Council here in the near future  But we're about to go to Mike and Leon and Melissa and Phil and others.  But before we do that, going back to Eric Pratt of Gun Owners.org, Eric, this article  your father's written, Larry Press written about the tyranny in the schools and the colleges,  go over that story for us and some of the examples because this attack on the first amendment  he is directly connected to the second the two are intertwined like the wings on  eagle  or you're exactly right and in fact it was  his eventually becoming  pro-gun that actually  really led to uh... his political transformation  uh... what what it happened was that some friends got to know the story for those  who joined his market down  yes some friends of his were murdered and uh... as it turned out he had to  drive past the spot  uh... where the murder took place almost every day  and uh... he you know as he got the thinking about that he thought you know  that they didn't have a firearm to defend them so well he went out and  bought a firearm now he was still a liberal still in the first uh... still a  democrat now describe his  what he was doing at the university who he was  uh... he's a uh... professor of criminology at the professor  and uh... so his comments and started working on it  absolutely  okay you can use a tenured professor  well he said it was actually that act this act of taking responsibility for  self defense into his own hands that eventually led to the crumbling of his  worldview the world view that says that  that we have to rely on the nanny state for all our needs and and as  it turned out he eventually became a christian and a conservative republican  to boot  uh... but this  but when this got out of course uh... infuriated  uh... and just shocked uh... the rest of the faculty course they can't do anything  now now that he's tenured  uh... but in fact you know he has these frequent sparring sessions with uh...  other fat faculty one of his fellow colleague  poker finger  in his chest and called him a dangerous man  because he had an inner a sticker on his door  uh... you know this is the kind of open mindedness that we have at the  university another time the same lady got in his face and yelled at him that uh...  George Bush is a buffoon. Regardless of what you think of the president and what's interesting about this is that this is the same lady  Who's conducting a study at the University of Estu whether or not there's a liberal bias at the University  So you know it's interesting  How does calls for tolerance come from those who are quite intolerant?  Well, of course. I mean they want their speech not ours. That's right. This is all gonna be  Selectively enforced and he's been through quite a lot  but i mean this is tayman comparison i interviewed a clinton in turn  who is a conservative  uh... and uh... this is about four years ago at temple university  uh... they were having the corpus christy  uh... play were christ is a is a gay prostitute  the christians were insulted by this in a match they had a thing where mama was a  you know gay prostitute right or whatever  and so they want they were a big christian group they were allowed to have their  own uh... rally they were gonna have their own time  they said no this guy had no record uh... top score in the school  he went into the principal's office and they when he refused to withdraw his  request for the meeting  uh... for the rally they tackled him  cutting put in a uh...  in a ambulance and taken  to the  this is the faculty yes to the university run middle hospital and the doctors  said we refuse to drug him and there's nothing wrong with this guy  but but the windows of the time that they were going on these people are on  such power trips that they think challenging them as illegal  uh...  all that that's horrendous now you know i gotta say my cattles as a great  uh... he's got a good sense of humor when he gets attacked  he says that he goes out and buys a gun that that he doesn't need just to make  the mad and of course he tells his opponents this you know thanks for your  views i'll go out and celebrate by buying another gun  so thanks to them he's gonna end up with a huge arsenal  uh... but uh... you know good for him for kind of keeping a good attitude  well it's a good investment  yet absolutely well and if he has kids and grandkids uh... you know it'll be  good to pass them along to them too because one day uh... they may not be able to  buy them as  as easily as we can today  but you know i'm not making the story shop  pastures reading  passages it's to be council meeting during the three-minute communication  of being arrested  i mean this stuff is really going on i can't believe it but it's really  happening  well that's a shame and uh... and you know  it's uh... i i i i i plaud what you're doing and getting the word out and  letting people know because people need to know about this and uh...  well i appreciate all the work that you guys are doing let's go back to the calls  i guess something that's just my turn on one of the things for holding mike or on  the air go ahead  yeah i i call the touch-based about instance that happened i had to take my  uh... sisters kids to the public school i'm not gonna private school  but real quickly i want to tell you that i have a thirty-odd six rifle and uh...  i moved uh... cross-pound last year and my daughter started new school here  private school but she made a lot of friends in the neighborhood  and she went and have a sleepover she's ten years old and uh... the parents  got win that i had a rifle  because my daughter had said that we have a gun to protect us in case someone breaks  in our house  her parents and now basically about four five other people in the room  won't even let their kids affiliate with my kids because i have a rifle in  my house  you know what what they need to realize is that they would have actually been  and greater danger driving their kid over to your house  then by staying in the house with the firearm  yeah you're twelve times more likely to be killed by a car but this is an  emotional thing it's like it is  i know people who won't go swimming in a light because they have fear of  shards  uh... i'm serious people but i don't think i want to tell you that i took my  dot my sister's kids to the third register for their public school as we  care about that a lot of times  and i'll tell you some that's unbelievable they have all these pollsters in  school talking about riddle and i mean riddle in advertisement uh... is your  child have a touch of the sort of  i mean they're advertising this stuff like the advertising candy  well sir under the new freedom initiative  they're gonna forcibly  psychologically test them twice  each year and the drug companies admittedly written the guidelines  and i'm gonna try to put them on any side college if you heard about that  earth  no i hadn't but uh... yeah that's well wow what what a problem that is another  wonderful thing what's fresh the democrats are gonna just  i think we don't you know i think like whether bush or carry get in there  a like you always tell exit the uh...  two sides of the same coin i think they know that i got it you're failed uh...  and i'm not voting  and i think people always say you know people who don't know what to speak out  and i disagree with that or hardly  uh... when you're not given a choice why would you make a choice if you're not  given a choice of somebody  uh... then boy the boat and independent results yourself and i'd be better off  well i would say this fight the electronic voting machines vote locally that's  with the real powers that in the congressional elections count but  uh... you know you're mentioning  what's happening in the schools  uh... what somehow we've got to take the schools back i mean  uh... josh sugarman of the violence policy center three years ago in the local  paper said  we've got your children we're going to ban guns that that's a paraphrase but  he said that  work where you'll wear those types of comments here  you know i was in alex and i'd like to if you'd email that to me i'd really  because I tell you we are really taking the battle to the schools now.  And education is an issue that you know normally you wouldn't think of a gun organization getting involved in issues like that.  But for that very reason that you just put your finger on we see there's a tremendous battle.  And unfortunately the textbooks and the teaching in the schools you know is chipping away at our national sovereignty.  It's praising dependence on the United Nations, downplaying the vision that the Founders  had on the importance of federalism, desecrating the Bill of Rights, especially the Second Amendment.  And he, unfortunately, this is an area where I agree with sugarmen that if things aren't  changed, they will have the hearts and minds of our children, and they will be banning  guns.  so uh... you know that this is a or a real key battleground where we really need  to you know in fact we were successful in this year in killing a bill  uh... that was going to expand  a lot of this education and and it was gonna like federal guidelines for  civics which we're gonna be all anti gun  exactly thanks for the call my  uh... leon leon where you call this from  uh... call riddle welcome sir go ahead yeah thank you and hello erica  Hi, Leon.  What I called about was that I took my work to the state  Republican convention, and I took my copy of the Constitution.  And one of my county commissioner says, what kind of H.E.  Double are you going to give everybody, because they know  and rather outspoken?  And I said, Jim, I said, well, I'm going to ask all of you  and their results, our county commissioner's off work.  I said, tell me when this was repealed.  This law was repealed.  It was enacted by the Continental Congress, I believe, in 1979.  Can you tell me when it was repealed?  I don't know, it just all looked at me.  That's the dumbest look.  And I said it wasn't.  And it's basic law.  And all the rest of this other stuff that you're passing  is legislation.  And it says right in here that it prevents anybody  from doing that.  Any congressman or anybody from passing any legislation  that is violating any of our  uh... bill of right  yeah that's the point is that they're violating the big supreme laws and why are  you doing it and then i went around to my representatives in my senators and i  have them the same question it was really fun to look  watch the dumbfounded look on their face because they had  answer  well what did they say to that  nothing  they were dumb found that they were just say it  they said well no it hasn't been repealed and i said well then  why are you passing legislation that violates your own  that says you are not to do this  and i can read in here it's it's an alleged  proceed  the bill of right says you  this is to prevent you from doing that  why do you do it  and they just  looked at  yeah this is the same kind of a you know leon brings up a great point and this is  the same kind of debate that ron paul gets into uh... represented from  taxes with his fellow legislators they look at him like he has two heads  uh... but you know he points to the after that's right that the supremacy  clause clearly says is the constitution  and laws passed pursuant to the constitution that are the supreme law  the land  and if a certain law  uh... doesn't correspond to the constitution and it's out of whack with it  then it's not truly law  all right they need to be reminded  thanks Leon Melissa and Phil but others are up next  with Eric Pratt, who also gave you the phone number for gun owners.

Thanks, Alex. God bless. All right, going back to the calls and then into more of the news,  We were talking to Phil in Virginia and I know Phil.  I've met Phil.  He's come to Austin.  He's a great guy.  Phil wasn't aware that you were street preaching and that you were arrested every couple  days.  I see a new article of this.  Well, you offended someone.  We're arresting you.  I mean, in a country where preachers don't have a First Amendment, we're in deep trouble.  Can you tell us what happened?  Well, yeah.  I had my bullhorn going first and the man came up.  the police officer came up and naturally they call for reinforcements.  But they said that I needed a permit for that.  So I told them that well I've been down to there so they're all trying to get their  permit and they don't know what I'm talking about.  So I said, well I'll just put the bullet horn down and just continue on.  Well no, you can't do that either.  so it was just uh... you know reminiscent of the uh... what i've heard you  cover  on your program about uh... you can't read the scriptures there and uh... the  state of Pennsylvania  it's pathetic  now  there was a case last year now a bama in a parade  no one was allowed to have the  and so the battle flag now whether you love it or hate it folks  it on the public street you should be able to walk around with a small flag  if you want to  or big flag if you want to and then the federal courts have ruled and bad in some  cases but good and most  and it's common sense you do not need a permit a permit is if you want police  for the block of street  if you want to march for the thousand people down the sidewalk  or ten thousand it is your right  and we won court cases right here in texas  uh... against governor bush when he arrested three separate groups of people  protesting on street corners of these were groups one group is handicapped  folks  and they're just on a  on the sidewalk they kept arresting them and now they don't do that because they  lost three one hundred thousand dollar  uh... lawsuit which is what they finally settled in court for  they can't do this but they still keep trying to do it  i thought we're not right to bring people freedom will then we'd operation  american freedom  uh... now were you arrested  oh yeah i was prevented from uh... uh... i had to produce uh... my identification  and all of that so yeah and technically that is an arrest so yeah  and uh... you know they threatened to uh...  they threatened to take me downtown  if i didn't produce a  uh... some identification  but uh...  yeah i mean i knew that uh... you know it was just uh...  uh...  uh... a ruse and that  you know it's just uh...  uh... but that's the danger of this uh... step story code system you know a code  violation in this country  is a death sentence  uh... well they got code violations where they take your house  they got these laws in the mexico  your twenty-year-old summer downtown has a beer party the cops bus you take  your house  but you can't get a jury or trial because  oh it's just a code violation where we're gonna take your two hundred  dollars dollar house  well they had uh... they they  uh... stop the man here in north all  uh... for a uh... trumped up charge  uh... and uh... by the end of the encounter the man was dead  this for a hanging license plate which uh... the evidence showed  was bogus. They were, man, had a leaking roof, another code violation. He ended up getting  shot six times. I mean, this is, we're not waiting for the police state. We are in it.  I was in crew, Virginia, went to a traffic violation. And I was parked on the side of  the road. Cops, this comes up. I wasn't in no parking zone. Nothing. No breaking, no  You demanded to see my identification.  And this is all about trying to find illegal people, or those who have a criminal outstanding warrant.  That's all these things are. These seat belt laws.  And they're all excuses to set up a checkpoint and search your vehicle.  that you have a warrant excuses  letting us know that they're the boss that they're god uh...  i tell you i would have let them take me to jail i'm not  i mean i should be out there preaching on the street corner of san your doing a  great job but uh...  it's it's a sad day in america when they are freaked out because  guys out there street preaching with a bullhorn  on a sidewalk  and uh... maybe you should get a good with some friends and have them arrest all  of you and then sue them individually for what they've done to you  Well, well, yeah, it's coming to that and  You know that you better have witnesses of the video camera or bad cops will grab you and then claim that you resisted  You're gonna have to have it on video. It's one of their favorite practices claim that you resisted  Well, I've learned a few tricks from you and I always like to have a video camera on hand  Well, you're doing a great job feeling  I'm sorry that this happened to you and and so I and then you go to the city and they say there's no permit for straight preaching  Yeah, or the loudspeaker, you know, and you try to play their game and you know, they just give you to run around  It's just ridiculous. I wonder why they came up to you. I mean, I wonder why they're freaked out by your first amendment  Probably because they just had some  Complaint  But it was in the middle of the day. We're not disturbing the piece. You know you want to be live peaceably with your neighbors  but yeah, they just don't like the message and  and all right well out criminal fill I appreciate your work in god bless you  yeah let's take care we're gonna go to broke in others here in just a minute but  but  definitely I want to play renegades because  this will make you think about how far we've come in this country what we've  turned into  and there's this whole backdrop of well it's the war on terror but it has  nothing to do with terror  so I want to play renegades for all of you out there like fill this is for  you fill  we're out there standing up doing a great job and just god bless you and I  love you  and i'm sorry this is happening to you  and whether you're concerned with the real liberal  you're losing your freedom step into the hammer engage  again  america is an america were not a free country  and so to all of you out there who love freedom this song is for you  we come back will take some more calls and cover some final days day with us  for everybody out there standing up against your any will break come back  to talk to brook recap of the stories  uh...  even in Jesus Christ time and Yahweh's time.  You were allowed to go out and preach and even in some cases criticize the government.  And that's what He was out doing.  And finally, too many people listen so they grab Him and they kill Him.  But in Germany and in Russia and in China, you can't do that folks.  And that's already what's happening here.  Third, in cases where people are denied permits dozens of times, they finally go out and  have a protest, they get arrested.  This isn't freedom.  I don't know how I have to explain that to the police and others out there.  If you've given an order to go arrest the street preacher, stand on there on the  street corner, I don't care if people don't like it.  The first amendment is what you have sworn up hold.  It's incredible.  And it is sad to see this happening in this country.  You know, we told you all this political correctness and this attack on free speech was  coming and this was going to develop and it'd be hate crime and all this.  now it's here  every couple days i see these articles  and it's getting worse and worse and worse where what we're what you're  plus three years ago there more advanced now we're gonna be there in three  years  and uh... didn't matter at George Bush or john carries an office because the  people become decadent  and forgotten what it is to be americans we lost our country now we got a  set about getting it back  but we've got to be honest with ourselves about how far we fall in  We're gonna get this country back.  And now they're trying to shut down  free speech and access to all of these  and then they're saying,  well, if it's criticizing it brief  or something or hurts about his feelings,  you're gonna be off the channels.  But that's not a violation of the First Amendment.  Oh no!  You don't have a right to hurt somebody's feelings,  Mr. Jones.

More than 700 chemicals have been found  in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals  by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?

I almost was gonna call Rush and ask him what degree  Mason he was.  Well that's your new conservatism.  Yeah right, that's number one point.  Number two point was your lady caller  that called earlier regarding the Masonic symbolism  was very fascinating to hear.  And I think she mentioned she was from Tennessee.  And I was wondering if you guys are aware of the fact  that the Tennessee State Capitol is laid out identically to the one in Washington, the  Senate's a giant pentagram. People say, well, why is the congressional level on our pentagram?  All it's just an accident. Folks, this is symbolism. Great thought goes into this.  Yes. And the last thing I wanted to mention to you was, I believe the last time I spoke  with you was about two or three weeks ago and we had a conversation about Rupert Murdoch  and the New York Post.

  "transcript": " It is Sunday, August 17th, 2025, and we're live on ancient faith radio.  You're listening to Everyday Orthodox.  Everyday Orthodox.  I'm your host, Elisa Beale, and Titch Davis.  And we get together here on Sunday nights to meet everyday Orthodox Christians.  And that's right, we're just building up church unity one person at a time.  And tonight I'm excited to introduce you to Karina.  Karina, I should actually say your last name and I don't have it written down Karina,  what's your last name? Quick. I'm like, panic. I'm like, ah, Karina Hall. I'm introducing  you to Karina Hall. Karina is the wife of Richard. She's the mother to seven grown  children, grandmother to three very lucky women. She was a licensed midwife, published  author, speaker and advocate. So I think you're going to find this really interesting.  recently published a book. It's called The Chicken with a Red Feather.  And it portrays the true story of her family's journey with Huntington's disease.  And she loves people, coffee, travel, and going to church.  And she goes to church at one of my favorite parishes.  So, that's true. She's at Christ the Savior. I've been, I've been Harrisburg, which  is just a really great parish full of neat people. But, and as is evidenced by the fact  that I'm just parading them all through.  But okay, Karina, welcome to the program.  I thank you for having me.  So delighted that you've come on the show.  It's really good, and I'm excited to hear about your book  and to talk about Huntington's disease.  And I feel like maybe raise a little awareness while we're at it.  So I think that'll be a good thing.  But mostly we just want to get to know you.  So tell me, start from the beginning.  Where does your story start?  Where were you born?  So I was born in paradise, California.  I was gonna say California,  because I'm from Northern California.  I'm like, we have a paradise, California.  Oh, no kidding.  I was born in paradise, California.  Oh, 1969.  So I made 50s or so.  Right in the heyday of the exciting hippie action  in Northern California.  Yeah.  I bet paradise was hippie central, frankly, at that time.  I was a skateboarder.  Oh, there you go.  I mean, yeah, yeah, but like very modern for that. Yeah. Well, we're a little too young to really be hippies  It's more our parents generation that we're crazy  We had our own version of it. I guess that slacker version of it  I'm saying yeah, I think I was trying to be more punk rock and then later became more like peaceful hippie  But California girl  for an erased.  Very nice. Very nice. All right.  So, so what was your family like?  Were you an only child with her a bunch of siblings?  What was the situation?  So I am the middle of three siblings.  I have two brothers and older brother, younger brother.  I'm the only girl.  So that made for, I liked it.  I liked being the girl.  That's a great thing.  I love that. I want to date today.  But that wasn't so great.  We're very close in age.  We both grew up in Northern California.  And I too am the middle with older and younger brothers.  And it really just meant in our family  that they had to do all the hard things.  And I got to do the really easy things.  Like you guys go out and like till the ground  and your sister will make sandwiches.  Yeah, yeah, I had all like the indoor floors.  For sure.  I didn't have to take up the trash.  Mm-hmm.  But I did do a lot of tours,  because maybe in my generation anyway,  in your generation, we just worked more, I think.  And I see now.  I try to get my kids to work and I do put them to work, but it's just different.  There's just also maybe not as much work to be done.  I don't know what it is, but it's very different.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you're growing up with your brothers.  You said you're a little punk rock, a little piece of neck as well.  And a little punk rock skater.  I love that.  I love that.  It's true.  That's so funny.  So what is that?  Like, what should I picture when I picture you as a punk rock skater at like 14 or something?  black clothes, dyed red hair, really short bangs with a Santa Cruz skateboard t-shirt on and  indeed. Yeah. That's awesome. Keep holding my own. That's so great. The first Reading California  Street style and I forget what your 1985. That's so cool. That's great. Okay. So when you were  skateboarding, that would be mostly guys, right? Like where you want pretty rare as a girl.  So not only did you have two brothers, but you were skateboarding with all the boys.  Yeah. And how was that? I mean, was it fun? Could you or like the girl and you got some  attention or was it painful? Because you were the girl and you didn't fit in.  I loved the guys because there was no drama. Nice. And so I really enjoyed hanging out with  the guys and I was going along real well and I loved the sport of skateboarding. So I was very  I dropped in the ramp and did some freestyle and street style.  And yeah, I was just like your California like sporty,  but yet, punky kind of girl.  But yeah, I love that.  I love that.  I have a friend kind of like that too.  She was from Half Moon Bay though.  So you guys probably didn't compete.  Oh, yeah.  But she was like the only girl in the crowd, but it was fine.  She was ran around that great time.  No, it's beautiful.  It's pretty easy.  There are no drama, I'm a no drama mama.  So I appreciated the voice for sure.  that works out. It works out very well. Alright, so as you're getting into high school, what  were you envisioning? Like, where you think in, I'm going to go pro, but you really couldn't  back then right before the X games, they didn't really have, right? It was really like  Tony Hawk and all those guys that got it going, I guess. But so what were you thinking  you would do with yourself?  I think I, at one point, I think I was hoping to go to a call like a SUSE Street, a  Susan, Pacific, I think it was.  Yeah.  I loved the serve.  I love to serve.  I love to body serve.  So we go to Santa Cruz, periodically and do that.  I was definitely not living a Christian life at all.  At that point, I was raised in a messianic,  some of the Adventist home.  So I was quite, quite rebellious.  What is a messianic, Seventh Day Adventist?  So Seventh Day Adventist, but more focus on the gospel  and less on Ellen White, who's like their profit.  Oh, yeah.  So I grew up about 15 minutes from Ellen White's house.  And so like, in your Anguin, California,  she was like down the hill in maybe on Bill or somewhere,  no other way, Calistoga more.  But she is a huge figure.  Like she really looms large in that region for seven days.  Yeah, but we have Adventist Health Systems,  which is a huge medical system that is all over  the West Coast. I don't know about here about shirts here too, but so I went to  Avenue schools, Avenue stalkers, Adventist Dennis, Avenue Hospital,  Avenue's chiropractors, five generations, seven,  the Adventist.  Well, and so were you guys vegetarian?  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Cause we have seen as an Orthodox  Christian is not as exciting for me. Right.  As fast as seen as an Orthodox Christian, if I just looked at it as food,  It would be nothing new.  It would be my life.  It's almost just on the beach.  It's definitely be like,  powerful about it because it doesn't feel  like I'm missing something.  Does that make sense?  I feel like I'm doing what I've always done.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, and it's almost,  but if you are eating meat on the alternate days,  those days in a weird reverse way have meaning, right?  It's like a feasting day,  a normal day versus a feasting day.  Right. So yeah, so no no pants when I was a kid only dresses. No jewelry of any kind. No nail polish.  Yeah.  No, anything nothing on the Sabbath, but like walks in nature. No right.  You bike. Like on the Sabbath was Saturday. Notably, not Sunday.  I mean, actually in Christianity, the Sabbath is Saturday. Right. We just go to church on Sunday.  We have Holy Saturday. Right.  Right. Yeah. I mean, you just don't go to liturgy that day. That's not liturgy day necessarily. Oh, it might be if you want to.  I mean, there were definitely some like some things in  Adventism that I obviously had to like work myself out of Adventism kind of come into  what real like Christianity looks like outside of that system because it's so defined and separate.  But I'm really grateful for my upbringing.  I'm really healthy.  And we had a very tight community my whole life.  Like I saw churches that knew generation after generation after generation after generation  after generation after generation.  That were the same people.  So there's kind of a beauty in that, you know?  But it's very rebellious from that.  Like very...  It's a tough culture, right?  Because for those who are not as familiar, I don't think a lot of people are really familiar  with seven day adventism.  It's a healthy culture.  They're all vegetarian.  We lived near a grocery store that was set  to the adventist.  And of course, there were no animal products at all.  So you couldn't run and get milk,  but you could run and get bread.  But that's kind of funny.  And then we didn't do any spending on the Sabbath.  We didn't shop on the Sabbath.  We didn't drive our business church.  It was a set aside day.  I have really great memories, because my dad loved nature.  So we always went on Sabbath afternoon drives and we would just land up on like Canada.  Wow. That was so cool. We just get in the car and we never knew we were going and we  end up somewhere in Michigan or not Michigan Montana or Rockington or the coast or Canada.  Like he would just get in the car. I've the church. We just spend the whole  weekend. That's amazing. Well, it's a beautiful area where you live  anyway, right? Paradise, if you just drove around. I mean, there's a reason they call it that,  Right. It's just a forest, right?  Yeah. It's, well, yeah, it burnt to the ground and the car fire.  90% of paradise burnt to the ground in 19, when I'm 2000,  19 or 19. Oh, my God.  I haven't lived there since we moved from California, we moved from  Redding, California to Pennsylvania in 2016.  So like, years after that, the car fire happened and a lot of my, a lot of our people, friends  and family members and they escaped 150 foot flames.  That's terrifying.  I think we haven't had the same problem.  There was a terrible fire that was crossed through probably around the same time.  And it was just all the stories were just horrific and the pictures were horrific.  Yeah.  That is one thing, you know, poor California, the fire, because I left before the fire  season was a thing.  never stopped at some point. When we were kids, there were fires sometimes. But when I, when I left California, there was a fire like seven months out of the year.  It's not all. There was always smoke. You couldn't go outside of your house. It was, I have asthma from living in California.  Yeah. Just, yeah. Oak was so bad all the time.  Yeah, I have friends who had to leave because their sons asthma was just too bad.  And he came to visit his uncle in Texas and was like, wait, he's okay outside of cat, you know?  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Yeah, it's terrible.  But so it's interesting though too, the seventh dad Venice culture, like you mentioned that  you were rebellious.  Like seventh dad Venice don't drink.  Do they drink caffeine?  They do drink caffeine, right?  But not alcohol.  Not, I feel like not much, right?  No.  No sugar, black pepper, mustard, capping, alcohol.  of any kind to back of any kind. Usually if you're a really good  Adventist, we two meals a day only. It's a whole theology on on the day of  a toenment. So their theology teaches that we live in the  anatomical day of a toenment. So basically we are all living in that one day  a year in the Jewish calendar. Every single day till Christ returns.  That's kind of cool. Actually, like that's a neat idea. That's not true.  But it's a really neat idea.  I guess that's the idea that we're fasting a lifestyle of fasting every day is why they're vegetarians.  And so it's like they're grasping.  It's like they're grasping parts of the true church and teachings of fasting orthodoxy.  And they actually, there's a lot of things they believe that are orthodox.  Like when I first started becoming orthodox, I was like, I've always believed that.  because that's what the adventist taught. So there's a lot that's true and there's a lot that I've been  able to grasp, especially coming from one more Judaic, a very Judaic background, or I maybe  identify more with Judiism that I would put the Christianity. That has a mess I am and I guess.  I think that's very awesome for me actually because it's gonna like, whoa, whoa, like,  I understand the Old Testament really well. I've read it my whole life.  And so I understand the Sabbath. I understand the rest. I understand grace.  So it's been very cool to like learn something and go,  oh my gosh, you know, like my brain makes loading with  with just like I've always known there had to be a  like a connection, but I didn't know what it was. And then when you hear it, you're like,  oh my gosh, how did I not know this?  This is incredible. And then you want to go back and tell everybody.  Yeah, that's the same part.  Right. And they're like, no, thanks. We're good. Yeah.  Because we're keeping the Sunday. So that would be like a  Yeah, which is interesting though, right? Because it's like, well, no, we  we believe that Saturday's the Sabbath. We're just not as good at not doing stuff.  But it's, you know, it's it's not actually that anybody argues about the Sabbath.  It's a people, no one people argue about it as ones who don't know what the  Sabbath is, right? Like if you think Sabbath means church day, then you're like, no,  no, no, it's Sunday. But not with this church day, then we're not rushing.  Yeah. Cause church day is definitely not a rather, it's not, it is a day set apart.  It is holy. It is beautiful, but it is not restful. Right. Any clergy person could  tell you that. Yep. So true. The last thing we would do is rest on the Saturday.  You gotta get stuff done. Yeah. But so your dad, he said he was a neat person.  We go on these drives that would just end up, who knows where, amazing, faraway places.  Because paradise is pretty far into Northern California.  I mean, it's not around the corner from Montana.  It's not, you know, that's a drive.  So I was born and raised in paradise, but we did live in Oregon.  Okay.  Oregon for a little time.  So that was kind of beautiful.  It depends on where we were.  But we have the Idaho for a short time.  I was born in paradise. I graduated high school in paradise. I have my first children in paradise. So yeah  Well, and you're little detours to other places where all equally gorgeous amazing  What was places like they're just I've lived in the North Pacific Northwest essentially so that's  Except for Pennsylvania so yeah, we're 3,000 miles if you look at a United States map  My daughter one time for Christmas made me this she drew this map out with black and white paint and  And like it's perfectly beautiful map.  And she took a red thread and she sewed the red thread  from, from Redding California,  where we wore it the time,  all the way to Hairsford, Pennsylvania.  And she put a little red pin there.  And if it could crazy to look at it,  because if you look at the map,  it's like equally left east to west,  like equally like the distance from each edge,  and like not least straight across.  Yep.  And so what do you have on my wall?  I want to say that Interstate 80 goes to Pennsylvania, right?  Because when you're in California,  there's a certain moment.  I can't remember where it is, but it's like on the road  to Sacramento from Napa probably.  But there's a sign that says,  it's like Philadelphia, this many miles.  And you're just like, what are you, what?  But yeah, I 80 goes right through.  You just stayed right on the freeway  and just moved right along the way.  And now we're living in Redding, California.  We were attending Bethel Church,  which is a very, very popular charismatic,  like a world international union.  There's that church for nine years.  And before we came to Pennsylvania,  so, but I came here for a midward free job.  And so we traveled across the country  and just took a leap of faith.  Wow.  So, you knew nobody here.  Well, I'm curious if there was something  a little bit familiar about living so close  to the Amish community,  because you guys are right out,  I mean, you're right in it.  You're in Amish country, right?  Yeah.  And so does it, does it,  they feel like there's kind of a kinship  between the Amish and the Seventh-day Adventists  or do the Amish seem like a whole other thing?  I mean, they are a whole other thing, obviously.  My mom used to say when I was growing up,  but I was half Amish as a joke.  And then I ended up serving and moved here  to serve the Amish community because I actually understand  what it means to have a religion be a culture.  So I wasn't confused by the fact that they were religious,  but had a culture because I grew up in such a tight culture  that I felt like at the time,  I remember believing in like,  I think God has sent me here to be a missionary to the Amish  because I actually identify with them.  I get along so well with Amish people.  I have Amish friends.  I can go to their house and we have dinners together.  We take, we take horse rides.  We're still friends, even after I've caught their babies.  And I really believe that there's just something very,  yeah, I mean, I don't believe it.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  I love that friend.  She is the one that is  Creating that life and pushing that baby out and doing that work. I'm just catching it. I'm just said  Here God here. Let me put my hands out. I'm gonna catch this baby  I'm gonna bless that baby. I'm the first person usually to be able to touch a baby  I always say mom put your hand on touch your baby  And I think that is so precious and dad come catch your baby. It's not my baby. I'm just the one that's helping making sure that things are kept  I was called a sacred space where I'm holding that space for them so they can have a normal  healthy birth away God designed it to be.  And I'm keeping things normal and I'm watching to make sure it can stay normal and very  few times I've ever had to go to the hospital.  That's lovely.  That's lovely.  That's a lovely way to think about it because it really is true.  There's always this person who has inserted themselves who often doesn't.  I mean, you know, even if a woman has a regular doctor, she can go to the hospital and  it's a different doctor on duty and there you go, right?  So it's such a stranger a lot of the time who has nothing to do with the creation of  this child.  And it's a sacred co-creation with God.  And then this random person just gets inserted literally and is sitting there, you know,  how beautiful to have the father, if possible, catching or, you know, and to see yourself  more as someone who's there to make sure nothing goes wrong or if something goes wrong  to make sure the right thing is done for it.  But not so much to run the show  and to think that you're part of the home.  And usually all the complications  that would happen in a home birth  are going to be weeded out in prenatal care.  So you're gonna have labs you're doing those things.  And so you know that, you know,  this is a very low risk birth.  I'm not doing, I have done two set to twins  and I have done a breach at home.  But for the most part,  I've done just single pregnancy  with, you know, lower swim and all really good experiences with all those things. But um,  and I'm very grateful to God for that. But I think that's because, um,  yeah, I just training is really good. And then I had really good training and I got my license,  but also I just have a relationship with God. And he said, I always say, Jesus is the best midwife.  So, you know, I can come in and do what I'm going to do. But the best midwife is not me.  I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  but everything is traumatic and stressful and dangerous.  Because birth is not dangerous.  Birth is a natural normal physiological function.  And most of us can give birth normally naturally.  And when we can't, we have the beauty of the medical industry  and the hospital and doctors that are doing their ministry.  But at home, I try to guard normal birth.  That's neat.  That's really neat.  It's interesting that idea that God is the best midwife.  And this sort of, you know, I think of,  and it's a much smaller way.  But like, even with Sunday school,  I've always really believed,  you don't walk around picking Sunday school teachers.  You just pray for God to reveal Sunday school teachers.  That's how the good ones come up, right?  But how much more so with that?  And I think with almost any project that we do,  if we can say, Lord, do what you want with this.  Like this is my offering.  Do take it where you wanna take it.  Sometimes that's nowhere.  And sometimes that's something amazing.  and whatever it is, you know, glory to God, like him.  He's running the show anyway.  So if we can cooperate with that.  Absolutely is.  And it's good to partner with him in that, especially as a midwife,  because, you know, it says, um, an exodus, the midwives feared God.  And so it's really important to remember that the midwives,  the ship are at in Pua were their names feared God.  And they didn't kill the babies that the Egyptian king asked him to kill,  because he were people were becoming too numerous.  And so they wanted the midwives to take out the babies at birth.  And the midwives said no.  It was a wholly disobedience.  And they feared God.  So I always think your primary goal as a midwife first and foremost is to fear God.  And your second is to serve that woman and give her hopefully the best experience that you can.  And when things are in gray areas, I'm trying to steer them back to normal.  And then when things are out of sight of an normal area,  no one to transfer and say, not be prideful,  stay humble and say, you know what?  We've done so good.  We really do need to go in.  And so what happens, which is not very often,  women trust, we trust each other  because we have a relationship.  I spend an hour, every month, we spend at least one  and a half hours together.  And then every two weeks, another hour,  and then every one hour, I go to their home,  I know their kids, their farm, their family.  So we're connected in a different way  than just a five minute visit with some of the comes in measures  and says, sounds good bye.  No offense to that.  They're serving hundreds of people.  But I really am privileged to be able to go into that home  and spend that time and really get to know somebody.  I really love that.  You minister specifically to the Amish community?  Um, 80% well until last year, about 80% Amish and about 20% English or non- Amish.  But yeah, I would say almost all Amish.  Okay.  What kind of the Amish community?  How is that organization then?  Is it an Amish organization that hired you like, who do you work for?  I don't work for, I work for my Jesus.  Okay.  I work for nobody.  I'm independent midwives.  So I'm licensing California originally and then I work as a traditional midwife in Pennsylvania.  But I have access to like I can file my own birth, my own birth certificates to the computer  through the state and I, yeah, my newborn screening supplies from the state.  So I'm connected but not connected.  That's neat.  That's really, wow, that is really, really cool.  And so, all right.  I'm sorry, I'm just sitting with this.  Like it's so cool.  I'm so interested in this idea that you went from like the 7th ad  bun this community to the Amish community.  And in some ways they're so far apart but in some ways they're so similar.  And that's the idea that you were comfortable with the idea that a faith and a culture are the same thing.  And as you're saying it, I'm thinking,  isn't it crazy that we're not comfortable with that in the US?  Because your faith should be so strong that it should color everything in your community, right?  like that. You know, when you think of Judaism, you think of orthodoxy,  and Greece, or in Russia, or wherever, I think, you know, we don't quite get it  yet because we don't have our American Orthodox culture ironed out enough,  but it's getting there. You can start to see it, right? Like you can start to,  if you're talking to someone about what she's cooking, you might figure out  that she's orthodox. Like, this is true. Especially if it's a Wednesday or  Friday. Yes, exactly. Like you can see those little signs. There are a lot of  little signs. But wow, how beautiful. All right, well, we are going to be taking a very  short break. And we're going to come back. And I want to talk definitely about your family's  journey with Huntington's disease, your decision to write a book about it. And I want to hear all  about that. So we will be right back with Karina Hall.  Here after Pazka, the Orthodox Church celebrates the Holy Mirbearers who cared for Jesus's  his body after he was crucified. But Murbaring has a broader definition. It can serve  as a metaphor for the practical, incarnate love to which Christ calls his followers.  In the art of Murbaring, author Elisa Bielotich Davis explores the lives of grace-filled  Murbaring saints in Scripture and throughout the life of the Church.  Offering questions for reflection in each chapter. By following the lead of compassionate  saints such as Joseph of Arimathea and Olga of Alaska. We can learn to embrace a simple  and profound way of life in ever deep and in communion with Christ and with others.  You can find this book at store.angentfaith.com. Again, that is store.angentfaith.com.  Welcome back to Everyday Orthodox. Tonight we're talking with Karina Hall from Pennsylvania,  although originally from Paradise, California,  and Corinna's a midwife.  And so we've been talking a bit about that.  And Corinna, I really do love what you were saying  about the idea that the midwives feared God.  And of course, that's a saved Moses  and so many other babies.  But it's also like what an amazing history  that to be able to lean on and what a beautiful thing  to be able to think about.  But okay, we have to move on  because I want to hear all about.  So I guess you were still in California  when you met your husband and or when you left seven dad  venism.  So tell me about both of those things  in whatever order makes sense.  Okay, so I met my husband in high school.  There were actually high school sweethearts  and we've been married for 37 years, 38 years in January.  So since 1988, we've graduated high school together in 1987  And we got married in January, 1988.  So about six months after high school,  we actually met the prom.  We knew each other before, but during high school,  he was like four foot nine or something,  like a little little junior and or freshman sophomore year.  And then junior kind of was like,  oh, he's kind of cute.  And then senior I was like,  oh, this kid's really cute.  And he's finally like my height.  I was like finally up to where I was.  So we hit the cut-off point.  Yeah, so we met at the prom.  We actually, I was going to the problem with one,  with a boyfriend.  He was going to the problem with his girlfriend.  We ended up talking all night long to each other.  And the next day, it's typical high school.  They got together and we got together.  Perfect though, because then they're consoled.  They're not mad, they're fine.  They're like, they're good for each other.  They're perfect.  I mean, I don't know how that ends up.  But, and so at the time, I had just recently come back  to walking with God again through young life,  which is a program through high school,  in Chico, California, actually.  And my husband was raised atheist and he's Jewish,  but with no Jewishness and atheists,  but with no talk about it.  So basically, just napping.  And nothing is you could possibly get,  and I was raised with so much,  that we had a lot to talk about.  So we met and we started dating then  after the prom, then after the prom  and we've been together ever since.  Wow, that's wonderful.  That's so, you know, that's adorable.  So you guys got married young though.  I mean, that's gotta be challenging.  That's gotta be hard.  Yeah, I was 18.  He was 19 for 20, less than 20 days.  And I was 18 for another like two weeks  when we married and we, we did nothing.  Okay, just to preface this ahead of time,  there was no Holy Matcharmoni,  there was no church wedding.  We got married, we married ourselves first.  And my mom said, you can't do that.  Show me your certificate.  So they're like, okay, so we hired an aura reader  to marry us on the beach in Vashana Island, Washington.  Oh my gosh.  Oh my gosh.  And we're not Orthodox, but you picked Vashon Island,  which is the home, of course,  of a well-known monastery with after free fun, right?  We used to see the monks all the time,  but I had zero idea of what,  I mean, I was raised to Adventist,  so I probably thought they were Catholic,  and I was like,  even if they, yeah, I wouldn't have even considered  what they were, but we had these monoliths on Vashons.  So after high school, we got in the car,  and we drove to Vashon,  And we lived there for like six months.  And we got married by the Ora Reader lady.  I don't know who she was.  What is that?  Yeah, Ora Reader, what is that?  Like a new age thing.  I don't even know.  I don't even ask.  We had a Christian wedding,  because at that time was again,  like not following anything per se.  We hired this Christian pastor to come do a wedding  for my parents, but we were legally already married.  So I technically have three weddings.  Right, a self wedding.  And my wedding, my mom's like, I don't think so.  And that was right.  I'm pretty bad.  I mean, I'm just here mom.  I'm like, she'll send me a copy of the certificate.  I'm like, I'll tell you what.  I mean, Northern California at that time,  all my antonine goals, they're all common law married.  And it's like, they had a service in the trees.  And so they're married.  that's like, you know what, that's not gonna work in court, man.  Like we went to a pie-placed market in Seattle  and got little rings made and put it in a little bottle  with little incense and flowers  and wrote a little love note about our love  and we threw it overboard on the ferry  into the Puget Sound.  Like boom, more married.  That's it.  I mean, in some ways we had it like understanding  that a piece of paper didn't actually make you married.  It don't make fairs there.  It'll keep you married.  So we had that like early understanding because we both come from divorce families and I think we just didn't want that to be for ourselves.  And that was kind of our reaction to that as a teenage mind.  Yep. And then I think that's really common actually right like this sense that like listen doing it the traditional way isn't working.  Like look at the end of the round us it's not working.  So trying to find something else is not it's actually not right.  actually not stupid. I mean, it's not great either, but it's not totally out there dumb.  No. And then we, when my mom said, we're a certificate, I'm like, oh, I better find somebody.  So I was taking a meditation class or something and I asked a lady if she'd marry us and  she did. And then my mom's like, well, aren't you gonna have a wedding with us there?  I'm like, oh, so then I had another wedding. I guess I just want a certificate. I mean,  Here you go.  She kept saying, I'll be in the ball.  You're just getting moving the bar.  What's going on?  That's so funny.  So we had a Christian wedding.  And yeah, my poor mom was probably inside just,  just not, she probably just shambled in.  But here, we are like the least likely couple  to still be married.  We have like no foundation in anything when we got married.  We were kind of messing with new age stuff  and hippie staff in general,  and doing drugs here and there,  not like hard things, but just hippie things.  And I feel like,  I used to say we were a wholly accident.  I love that.  But then last year, when I said that out loud,  I heard the voice of the Lord say,  don't say that anymore.  You worked really hard to say, married.  I'm like, you know what?  You're right.  I'm not really hard.  37 years is not a wholly accident anymore.  I'm in.  And I think it was like, I've been saying that for so long, he's like, I was like, I'm  going to give that.  And I realized, okay, it does, it takes the choice because even if you're not able  to love that person the same way all the time, which if you're married, you know what  I'm talking about, love grows and changes with time.  You always can love the third person in the marriage.  You can always love God.  And you can always love you back and give you what you need, even if you partner can't.  And so I think of that over time, as we both became believers, I was 22 when I got  baptized as a Christian again in the force for gospel church.  My husband was 23 when he became a Christian by a dream.  He had a dream that he was sitting in a meditation room.  It's all he probably knew at the time to dream about.  And there was a star David on the wall.  And he was looking at the star David and he sat down  and he started to like go into this trance in the dream.  And he looked at me and I was like,  Richard, Richard and the dream was in the dream with him.  Where are you going?  He goes, just take your place.  Just take your place.  I'm like, where are you going?  Cause I can see that he was like losing the around him.  And the star David became a kaleidoscope,  but it was a star David with this.  started David with the star David.  He followed it in the dream  and landed on the face of Jesus Christ in his dream.  And he said,  it went,  and he said,  the minute he saw Jesus's face,  he knew that he was God.  No one told him.  He said,  he knew he was God.  And then he woke up and he was like,  he called me,  I was a business my mom in Luddai, California.  And he called me,  I was like, I'm a question now.  I'm like,  what are you talking about?  I was in Luddai.  What do you mean?  I'm like, we're Christian.  You were Zen Buddhist last time I saw you.  And now you're, what?  Like, it's been 15 minutes.  What are you talking about?  I knew I'm like, what do you mean?  And he's like, I saw Jesus face  and I went to a Catholic church.  And I talked to a priest and I'm like, what?  He's like, yeah, he gave me this card to pray.  The hell Mary and he's like, I told the priest.  I didn't see Mary.  I saw Jesus's face.  He didn't have a theology yet.  And so he, then we started going to a little Orthodox church  in Eugene, Oregon.  That's what we're living then.  Really?  Yeah, Tint John, Tint John the Wonderworker.  Wow.  It's our first Orthodox,  which was our first church as a Christian couple married.  By that time we had  Autumn was born in Paradise, Kyle Paradise,  Zoe was born in Eugene, Oregon.  So by the time we were in Oregon again.  But wait, so hold on.  You can't catch up with my move.  Yeah, wait, where's the fourth square time?  When were you at the fourth square church?  When were you, okay?  So was you were in the charismatic church  and then the Orthodox church?  Or was it Orthodox,  you're a medical Orthodox?  No, that's right.  And then the Orthodox church for a very short time.  And again, it was like confronting all of my Adventist beliefs.  Like I saw that Father David and Esther were the priest  in his wife.  And I remember him bowing down and kissing the icon.  I'm like, oh, idolatry.  And I just didn't have a great foray.  I was, we didn't even have a cross in our church.  I had no grid for anything physical,  except for they all have the three angels  on their stained glass, but,  right, but that they don't have crosses in the churches  and then where crosses, we don't wear jewelry.  So I didn't have a grid for it, but I felt drawn to it.  But so then we went to St. Mary's Catholic church  for a little while.  And I was like, I can't be Catholic,  but that's a way to, I can't be that.  And so we became Quakers for seven years.  We were Quaker at the Evangelical Friends Church.  No way.  We were Quakers still in Oregon,  or were you Quakers now in Pennsylvania?  Oregon.  Oregon has Quakers.  I didn't even know.  Yes.  Look at that.  And they were wonderful because they listened to our questions.  And they could say anything we wanted to,  they didn't think it was weird.  We were just like, my husband was coming from such a different  background, I was undoing religion and trying to find what I  believed in all this. He was like starting to learn anything at  all about reasons of God. So it was kind of a beautiful little  landing place for us. And of course, it was hippie and peaceful  all that. So my path on the Quakers are very big on like you  finding your own revelation, right? Like on your own experience of  So I could see where that would be kind of a low pressure,  comfortable, good place to be.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So how do you come back to the Orthodox Church?  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  So you wanted to skip to that part?  I want to go, no, no, no.  You know what?  Don't skip anything.  Just talk.  Just tell me the story.  Yeah.  This is a great story.  So we ended up after we became Christians,  we decided we just were going to let go of us on our family.  we're not gonna, you know, we were just gonna let that happen.  And so that's why we have seven children.  We wanted 12.  We actually shot for 12.  And people were like, are you guys more man's or Catholic?  They're like, no, we just let children.  We just love babies.  We think babies are great.  And we lived in, we moved to Redding, California.  And I was in midwifery school.  I was working in Redding as a midwife in a Birken Center  and also like interning, I guess.  And yeah, and we just moved from,  we'd moved the Sacramento to a house there for a few years  and moved back to Reading.  So we're kind of in the same area,  within a couple hours.  Paradise Sacramento already all really.  Same kind area.  And my husband, that time we had seven children  on youngest Lydia was seven.  And we'd been in Reading,  but we moved there for Bethel Church  and we had been in Reading maybe like,  Let me think nine months or something.  We didn't know a lot of people yet.  I'm sure.  I'm doing a big, big church.  And my husband worked in Sacramento, so he was commuting back and forth.  He was a tech, he was a tech, who's a web developer, software engineer.  So, and I was midwife working in the student.  So, and we had a lot of kids.  And I was homeschooling some and some weren't college and some were in regular  school and some more charter school in summer homes.  It was, you know, I was working full time, but it's just crazy time.  I don't even know how we did that.  And one day, this is a Huntington's journey.  One day, my husband, watched probably back up.  So we'll make more sense of it back up a little bit.  When we were in Sacramento, and my husband's mom died of Huntington's,  she was only 56 years old.  So Huntington's is a neurodegenerative disease and it affects your thinking, walking, talking,  swallowing basically, it generates you into the point where you can't do anything for yourself.  You are in diapers again and you basically degenerate, you stop being able to swallow, and  then you intentionally die.  But it's a very long process.  So it's like having ALS and Parkinson's at all times in one disease.  So imagine all those three things as one.  So my husband and I, in Sacramento, we're both dreamers.  He had a dream, and in this dream, the Lord told him,  you need to go see your mom.  Well, his mom had been on drugs.  Old hippie, lots of alcoholism.  Really neglectful of her kids.  Like, his younger sister was taking care  of her younger two twins.  One who was multifally bad with disabilities.  She eventually died.  And that dad that was in alcoholic,  and she was out in bars and drinking because she had hunting  tins and there was no test then,  and there was no way to, no medications then.  And so she was just living wildly  because her mind was changing  and leaving her kids at home for days and without food.  So he hadn't talked to his mom,  and we hadn't really had them around our family,  her around our family because it was a very toxic environment.  Very sad, but at the time we didn't know,  that we thought was just drug South.  Paul, we didn't really realize it was Huntington's.  Cause that was before,  in 1994 when there was actually a way to test for it  and tell them there was no way to test for it.  So what the doctors are saying is that in retrospect,  all of this erratic behavior is really related  to the cognitive decline and just all the weirdness  of Huntington's.  That's right.  So all of that was happening.  And you get this bitterness in you because you think  just doing it on purpose and why don't they get their act together and all those things you think.  And when you find out when we got the letter that his mom was sick eventually in 1995 or for  pregnant with my fourth child Levi, we got this letter. We're like, wait, what? And it's genetic and  all of our kids are a 50, 50 at risk. So I'm like, oh my gosh, like, are we gonna keep trusting God now?  Because we said we were gonna trust God or new believers. And so we said, we're gonna trust you.  I'm pregnant. We saw a genetic counselor.  But fast forward, we made that decision to continue letting God plan our family, which we had never regretted.  She had a dream that he was supposed to go see his mom and him. And the same week, someone from our church, I come up to him and said,  have you forgiven your mother? And he was just like, wait, what? And she's like, have you forgiven your mother?  I feel like you're supposed to forgive your mom.  And he's like, I haven't talked to my mom in five years.  I don't even know where she lives.  That's a real story.  And so then he had the dream,  and then he woke up and told me, I said,  if Nancy said, go see your mom,  and then God just told you to go see your mom,  better find your mom.  So that was the Thursday.  He left on Friday.  He drove back to Eugene, where again, where she was,  and looked for her for the whole weekend.  He didn't find her Friday.  He didn't find her Saturday.  He was desperate.  So any morning he said, he called me crying,  and I can't find my mom.  Like, where could she be, right?  So he's looking for his mom, looking for his mom.  He can't find her.  He found me at noon.  He calls me sobbing.  He said, I fell my mom.  I said, oh my gosh.  She said, I called every number in the phone book.  And she was at the last five numbers  in the phone book for nursing homes.  And the nurse had come right now.  She's dying.  I said, what?  He said, she's dying.  I said, well, go.  And then call me, you know, when you find out.  He found her at 12.30, and she died at 4.52 in his arms.  True story.  Wow.  He held her.  He held her.  He sang Christmas carols over her,  because he didn't know, he didn't know what was mean.  Those were his.  Their hands would be incredible.  They didn't know.  Oh, don't worry, pray for her.  After she knew the Lord and wanted to know Jesus  before she died,  he just let her as close as he could to the Savior  and then she died right in his arms.  And then his sister called him as like,  how did you know to be with mom?  And she was dying.  He's like, I didn't.  Everybody was like mad at him.  Like how could we even tell if he was done?  Why didn't you tell us?  I can't tell her.  Yeah, he's like, you know, he didn't have time.  So she did his also.  And he was the one who was praying.  Right.  And her.  He's the only one that's a Christian in his family.  There you go.  And I just feel like God just like led him there  and was with her.  So she wasn't alone.  Is her first born son?  Yeah.  That's right.  And then his brother was like,  I can't understand what's happening right now.  Like this is weird.  This is weird stuff.  That's a crazy story to hear for sure.  The baby her spirit was calling to you.  And you know, he's like,  I don't think it was her.  She's not magic.  But yeah.  Yeah.  But it was a very, like, whoa, you know?  And that was the first time that we, I think he truly  forgave her that day, which was very important to do.  And I think that it forever changed our lives.  Because she's like, wait, she's young.  Right?  Right?  So when he, so he has Huntington's as well, right?  He inherited it.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did you find out?  So in 2009, we lived already in August 8th of 2008.  And then May of, or I'm sorry, in February, 27th, 2009.  I don't forget that date.  I had someone in labor supposed to go to the birthing center and be an assistant first  mid-wife at the birth.  And my husband goes back and forth to work from Sacramento.  About two and a half hour drive to ready in two hours and maybe 50 minutes from relived.  And so I knew he had left work at noon because he always left around noon that day on Friday.  And it was like, he should be home about 330.  I wouldn't give the kids from school came back.  No husband.  I make dinner if he had the kids.  No husband.  I get to nighttime.  They're, I put the kids to bed.  No husband.  I tend to talk I'm freaking out.  I'm like, where is my husband?  I'm calling leaving messages,  going right to voicemail.  I'm like, something's wrong.  Like what is happening?  So I put a little thing on social media,  hey, please pray.  Like my husband hasn't returned from home.  I think I'm gonna start calling hospitals.  I called his employer.  He left at noon, 1230.  He just disappeared.  And so I called the police and like,  we can't help you for 24 hours. So as I've known tomorrow, I hope you're missing person. But  right now, we just have to wait and see. So I called everyone of our family members and said,  look, maybe he knocked the road in this truck. You know, it's, I think it's the interstate five.  It's pretty straight, but there's a lot of like ravines and creaks and things. He could  have fallen into a ravine. He could be upside down in a truck. He could be needing help somewhere.  So we called the forces up. And I mean, we had everybody looking for my husband up and down  from Sacramento to Reading, California, every bathroom, every camera from a gas station,  every place we could possibly look. We have people praying all over the world and praying.  And no husband, just gone. Got back around four o'clock in the morning. I'm like,  where are you? And I'm asking the Lord, like, where is he? And all I knew, and I don't know how  to tell you how I knew. All I knew is that he was cold and he was wet. And I don't know how I  I actually physically felt cold and wet.  Like I don't know, babies, there's some like marriage,  you know, God's ordained connection there  and that, I mean, no, there is with marriage,  but like there was just something about it.  And so another person called and she was like,  how'd they praying?  And I just really feel like he,  he's somewhere like west of I-5,  like toward the oceans.  I'm like, okay, well, we'll start looking  that direction because I mean, hey, you know,  maybe God's speaking in this different way.  And so we started looking that way.  No, no husband, no new, new kids came back from school, no husband.  It was like in the evening that night, I finally got a call from the police.  And they found him three and a half hours west of I five in the national forest,  hiking by himself.  His car was in a creek stuck and hiking out with no cell reception for 17 hours of  hiking all that time. He talked to miles and miles and miles in in work clothes with no water, no food.  He in his brain started to change a little bit and he decided that would be a good idea to take a logging road home in February in Northern California.  And of course, a logging road gets narrow narrower. He found me went down into a creek, realized he couldn't turn around realize he had no cell receptionist running out of gas.  went down into little ravine to come back the other side of the road and a creek was down there and when he went over the water it just sunk in and started filling up with water.  So we jumped out of the truck into the back of the truck, got some clean water from the rain in the back of his truck and high to 17 hours.  in the North of Urcy. Wow. That's one way to find out that you've got some cognitive shifts.  Yeah. So when he got so dramatic, oh yeah, we in all the new, was on international news,  on national news, it's gone all over by that. Right. And you know, husband of seven disappears,  you know, and when he got home, I don't know whether the hug and were killing him. Right?  I was so, I was like, if this is intentional,  I don't know that,  who are you?  You have is broken.  Like I don't know.  Why would you do that to me?  I thought you were dead for real.  Right.  And how could you do that to me?  If this is an intentional, this is H.K.  This is Huntington's.  And so I just said,  I need to make a line here in the sand.  This is the line.  You're going to get tested or we have a problem.  We have a problem.  Right now you're being tested.  And so, yeah.  And so he decided, yeah, he said, I know.  He was so sorry.  He said, I'll get tested.  But he told me two things.  He said, when I get tested, you have to promise me.  You'll never lead in a nursing home.  ever. And that, and that you will, and that you'll put me in front of some amazing worship  when I can't talk anymore. So I can just be in God's presence. So I said, okay.  And so we got a call May 17th, 2009. So this would be like three months later,  after a series of psychological evaluations and blood tests and all that.  And the doctor calls and all we were all like everybody was on like, you know,  notice because we knew she was calling.  And we knew this was results which is going to change our life.  And I just knew he had it.  I just and he doesn't have it.  I'm fine.  I'm like, okay.  That's not the dog called.  Yeah.  And we said, we put the phone down.  And we said, hold on a minute.  I said, hello.  Hi, this is Dr. So and so.  I said, okay, can you learn the minute?  So as a happy result, I know, one second.  Put the phone down, we got in our knees,  and we just said, God, this is up to you.  You knew beginning from end, we don't know it,  but help us through it,  because we've always been taught,  don't ask why, ask how.  So we don't know how we're gonna do this,  but we're gonna do it.  Because why is kind of like self pity, like why?  No, no.  How was like, how can we get through this?  So we got up and said, okay, hi, here we are.  And they said, he's positive.  And we just cried and sobbed and cried.  And then we called our pastor,  we're like, how do we tell our kids?  You know?  And they're older now.  We have older, we have college age, high school,  junior high elementary.  And he said, we'll tell him in age bracket groups.  So it broke him up until that little parts  and told him each one.  He got to our youngest daughter, Lydia.  She was seven.  And we said, we told her.  And she goes, I know what you're trying to tell me.  And she runs in the other room.  And we hear her put on this, like, kids worship CD.  And she's in the room and she's singing.  And we're sobbing, because our response is like, not bad.  She's like, I'm never gonna stop praising you.  She's us.  And she's in her room and she's crying out.  She's little.  And she's saying, Jesus, I'm never gonna stop praising you.  And I cry, I think it about it.  And she comes back in and we're like, humble.  Like we're like, what is this kind of response?  Right.  And she says, I know, God, she said,  Jesus told me he's gonna heal daddy.  And I said, you're right.  He is gonna heal daddy.  And however he wants to.  And she said, and so we just,  and so we took that as like,  healing doesn't always look like what you think.  supposed to look like. He and sometimes looks like what you need, not what you want. So what we  learned. And so we just said, okay, like we kept living our life. I took a year of just a  grief. I needed like a whole year just to get our everything back together. We could function  and just to accept it and kind of move with it. And I had this world of the time over my life that  that I was like everyday grays, like everyday grays.  Just everyday grays, God, everyday, not the day before,  not tomorrow, just stay here and your everyday grays  keep me here.  And so that's how we blibbed,  because I don't know how to live in this, this much grief  and this much yuck.  Yeah.  Any other way.  I don't know how to do it any other way.  There is no other way.  So we just decided to love better than we love before  and take it one day at a time, which we've done.  And that was what that would be like,  Lydia's 20, 20, 25 this year.  Wow, this was 20 years ago.  It was 20, 24 years of,  and be 20, 18 years I think.  Yeah, 18 years of diagnosis  and 10 years of caregiving in October.  But I've caregave now for him for 10 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and so you know, God willing to address,  you'll do it for a long time.  It's hard to.  Yeah.  You don't know.  I mean, he's on hospice now, but that could be.  That could be a long time too.  Yeah.  So it has been a definite like process.  And that actually that process and that suffering  that our family has had to walk through.  That is why we're orthodox.  You can go for the joy anywhere,  but you're not gonna find the joy this deeper than sorrow  without finding Christ himself.  And you're not gonna find the life that gives life  to our mortal bodies about the Eucharist.  So for us, if people are like,  oh, your orthodox says so, like, cool, am I really?  I don't want to be what the rocks.  I'm saying it with the set.  I said it not want to be.  I was like, I'm not worth the rocks.  Like you cannot make me worth it.  I was going to messian on fellowship.  We were keeping Shabbat.  It was beautiful.  I just,  I was a father's thing from,  from my mind actually.  I fought it hard.  But,  yeah,  but it was the suffering.  It was the understanding.  It was the understanding of suffering as something that could be actually something that  refines us and makes us better.  And it isn't running, not like we have to have it, but we kind of do because we are lousy  without it.  I mean, it's just true as awful as it is.  And as much as nobody wants us to say that, the truth is if there's nothing wrong, you  You just don't have to rely on God and you just never do.  Right.  And then God changed our whole marriage had to change  because things were got really hard  because his mind changed first.  So for some people, physical and the mental come together,  come together, mine was his was all psychological.  Suicide ideation, ready to kill himself one night.  He was at a nursing home for 10 months.  He didn't want to come home.  He was really, really hard for us to be around.  He was abusive to me.  He was kind of abusive to the kids.  He didn't mean to be, but he could help it.  So we're living with this person that like,  you know, isn't, we're like, I tell my kids,  that's Huntington's talking.  That's not your dad.  Yeah, but that's really hard to take in as a kid.  And so that's really hard to take in as a wife too,  but it's really hard as a kid.  It was just an awful time.  I started to not like my own husband.  I loved my husband, but I didn't know.  I was married to an actual stranger.  I didn't know this person was anymore.  And so that became really, really difficult until,  until he went to the nursing home.  I had that little 10 month break.  And in that 10 month break, God did something really  miraculous with my heart.  He began to show me what covenant looked like.  As one time a pastor said, do you love your husband?  And I said, no.  But what he should have asked me is, are you in covenant with your husband?  Yeah. And I would have had yes.  Yes. And I don't like him.  But I'm not going to go anywhere.  But the Lord did a work on my heart in that 10 months.  If time and I had read 1 Corinthians 13, a thousand times in my Christian walk, a million times.  And in and in that time that I had read that 1 Corinthians 13,  I never read love doesn't fail like I read at that night.  And I was like, I don't know this kind of love.  Yeah, I don't know if I don't know that kind of.  Too much, right?  Only God has that kind of love.  And I know God has got it.  No way.  And I started repenting and telling how sorry I was for  with holding that love from him because I didn't have  that I needed anymore and I had all these excuses.  And the Lord gave me a great set night that I have never  been without since that day, that would be 2018. And I've never ever  lacked the love for my husband since that moment. And it was like this.  It just was like a grace to be whatever he needed and receive nothing in  return, but have everything I needed from God along. And that was that was  really needed.  If so, as we close up, I just want to know. So if any of our listeners are  entering into whether it's Huntington's or something else,  it's really difficult, especially with caregiving  and with loved ones.  What advice do you give them?  If we're entering into it?  Yeah.  As they enter into it, is there anything to hold onto?  Is there anything to help them stay?  Whoa.  Kill your expectations first.  Clean to God, always.  and take it literally take it one day at a time,  because that's all you have.  You don't have tomorrow, you don't have the past,  you have today.  And if you screw up, it's okay,  I screw up all the time.  I praise here is all my bickering.  Trust me.  And all the things that I feel like I've just done wrong.  But at the end of the day, I'm still here.  We're still married, even if there's not that same marriage.  It doesn't have a same marriage anymore,  but this is the same covenant.  That means change. Right. Right. Um, yeah. And, and, and don't be too hard on yourself.  Cause and also nothing's no, no one has any tense person is the same. Yeah.  So don't don't, don't try to isolate watch videos and like try to like tell my brain how it's going to be later.  I'm not that at all. We hate the unknown, but that doesn't work.  No, you don't learn to live with the unknown. Try to stay today.  Try to stay present with your emotions. Try to stay present with God.  to try to be honest about everything because, like Father Stephen always says, God doesn't  care about our sin so much as he cares about our honesty. So it's really, really important  to remember. It's okay to be honest. Be honest with the right people.  Yeah. That's what you have.  Oh yeah. Well, Karina, thank you so much. It's just such a blessing to have gotten a chance  to sit and talk with you. I so appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having  Well, and thank you to our audience for joining us.  And come on back.  We're gonna have another everyday Orthodox Christian right here on every duerth at Oxford.  We'll see you then.  Good night."

  "transcript": " We don't know how to do it.  You would need very smart systems that are much more reliable than what we have to really  underwrite the agents that people want right now.  And so we're getting like a sneak preview of the future, but it'd be like getting a sneak  preview of a car in 1850 and, you know, one in four of them blows up in your face.  It's like, we should probably wait on that.  Let somebody else test drive those things and they'll, you know, they'll learn that gasoline  is explosive and that, you know, maybe you shouldn't be in the vehicle when you fuel  and stuff like that, which people  would learn to vote.  Apple actually had in their system  from about a year ago, maybe still do.  Told the systems, be truthful, don't make stuff up.  Don't hallucinate.  And then they did anyway.  That's a simple version of alignment.  I'm going to tell you, don't make stuff up.  And I could tell that to an intern working for me,  an employee.  And if I told that to an employee who was working for me  and they kept doing it, they'd be gone.  Exactly.  But LLMs instead of being gone, we're  giving them another $500 billion in funding.  It's kind of insane.  Everyone, David Bumble, coming to you from Black Hat  with a very, very special guest.  Gary, welcome.  Thanks for having me.  Great to meet you.  My team have been telling me so much  about what you've been sharing  and I've been watching your videos and stuff.  So happy to have you on the show,  giving us a reality check about AI.  But before we even get there, something big has just dropped.  It's very just minutes, literally, before I came.  GPT-5 Open AI dropped GPT-5.  They did a public announcement of GPT-5.  And I have to say, for most people,  it's probably disappointing.  People have been talking about GPT-5  since GPT-4 came out.  That was 32 months ago.  And in fact, Bill Gates saw a preview of GPT-4  four years ago if I have my math correctly.  No, three years ago.  Three full years ago.  And ever since then, people have been like,  wow, GPT-5 is gonna be amazing.  In fact, I just tweeted about it.  picture with Kevin Scott, his Microsoft CTO, with a little picture of GPT-3 is some tiny little  sea creature. I guess it's a tiny little whale. And then GPT-4 is a little bigger, but  noticeably bigger. And then GPT-5 in this diagram that Kevin Scott did about a year ago is his giant  humpback whale. And what I've been saying all along is it's not really going to be this great  humpback whale. It's going to be like the other systems a little bit better, but not hugely better.  And that's kind of what we saw. GPT-5 is better on many benchmarks. The biggest thing about today's  presentation, they already got nailed at minutes into the presentation, which is they showed all  these benchmarks and they say, we're better on this, we're better than that. Sam Altman says,  this is the smartest model of all time, but they didn't report Francois Scholé's  Arc AGI-2, which is a benchmark a lot of people pay attention to and that they pay attention to  in there, about three and demo six months ago.  Didn't mention it.  Well, guess what?  It doesn't even beat Grock four,  which came out a month or two ago.  So we have this story we keep hearing  about exponential progress.  Someday I know vaguely from Twitter posted today.  I don't wanna hear about exponential progress anymore.  This is someone who is enthusiastic  and kind of believing that it has become disillusioned.  I think a lot of people are slowly realizing  that they've been sold to Bill of Goods.  It's one thing to say each model's gonna be  a little bit better than the last.  Well of course it's going to be you spend a billion dollars on the model, you should get some return on your investment  mutuals up, but that doesn't mean that these things are AGI, artificial general intelligence.  This new model, definitely not AGI, can't even be crock on this one test.  There's incremental progress here, there is nothing like this giant humpback whale leap that we've been promised.

Because I keep hearing the hype, right?  AI, this AI that everyone's got AI on every product.  But it seems just to be a lot of hype, a lot of the time.  I mean, there's real progress.  So, you know, the systems today  are definitely better than systems three years ago.  But the hype is like this is going to solve all your problems.  Reality is there are some context for it.  I mean, what we learn at this conference  is that the biggest context for it,  which is coding, actually, is huge flaw.  So for the last year, everybody's been talking about agents  and how great they're going to be.  I kept saying, come on, hold your horses.  They're going to be flawed because they have multiple steps.  Every individual step with an L.M. is actually a risk.  Something's going to go wrong.  So you put them together, get serious problems.  And there were two talks here, one from NVIDIA,  another this morning from Nathan Hamill,  showing that these things called prompt injection attacks  make these systems like total sitting docks.  So if you use one of these so-called  level three agents as NVIDIA's terminology is,  it goes out in the web.  It looks for examples.  And those examples, I think they call them like  watering wells or something like that,  are just filled or can be filled with bad code  that does terrible thing.  So they show basically live, or not quite live demos,  but recordings of demos where they would ask a system  to create this bit of code.  In next thing you know, someone basically  had control of their system, remote code execution,  which is basically the worst thing they can happen to you.  And they showed not one, but a dozen different ways  to do this.  And each of those ways is actually some huge attack surface.  So essentially any code that you can get the systems to absorb  becomes an attack surface.  And so those are just huge problems here.  One way to think about is we want our AI to be safe and secure helpful and so forth.  That means we want to be able to instruct it.  We want to tell it stuff.  So the funniest in an ironic dark sense of funny dark, dark humor funniest thing in this  talk is somebody put in or they put in in one of the like basically like a system product,  user prompt for the coding, they put in only right secure code.  This is to have no idea what that actually means, right?  It's like when you tell the system to do this bank transaction for me and it says, I'm  on it and it doesn't actually know your passwords and so it can't do it.  It's just spouting things that people say, if you asked it, are you writing secure code?  It might say that it is, but the reality is it's not.  It doesn't have a deep enough conceptual understanding of what secure code is.  And the same is true in any domain.  So we've seen it delete people's databases and all that.  Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that because we had black hats.  And I mean, my big concern with this is the cybersecurity piece.  I'm glad you mentioned agents because if you got agents supposedly doing everything autonomously,  they're not riding secure code.  I mean, it's an attack as paradise.  You know, maybe 20 years from now, agents will write really great code.  There'll be much better than humans.  But we're going to be in a transitional period for a while where agents are going to write  shit code that is not really secure.  Is not as good as the best coders can do.  Partly because the best coders aren't like taking everything off random repositories that  they don't understand.  And they understand the code that they're using.  They're good.  I mean, bad coders have always been a problem, but good coders have a conceptual understanding  of, you know, what a memory overflow error is.  And they look at some piece of obfuscated code.  They're like, I'm not putting that in.  I don't know what that does.  It looks like a bunch of digits because it's, you know, been obfuscated and they know  better than to use the code.  But these systems, these agents systems don't really know what to use.  And so it's just, they're sprinkled with so many vulnerabilities.  And if you use these systems only to say, hey, what's a way I could write a piece of code  for some small little thing?  Like, I want to learn how to translate this into bold and Unicode.  Right.  You can look that up.  You could have looked it up on Stack Overflow before.  Now you can use ChatTPT or Cloud or whatever to find that piece of code for you.  That's fine.  That's not what I mean by full agency.  Full agency is like, I have bug reports on my code.  Go fix them.  It's not me finding one little piece of code that I with my human eyes can check out.  That's like leaving the system with a lot of autonomy.  And it's really when that autonomy comes in that you have problems.  I know you were just interviewing, I want to get his name right, Michael Hippone and I saw  his talk yesterday.  And what's the title of his book?  If you make it smart, it's going to be vulnerable or something like that.  It's if it's small, it's vulnerable.  It's smart, it's vulnerable.  Well, that is true in spades with an asterisk in this situation.  These things are not really smart, but the given powers, right?  It's really, if it's autonomous, it becomes vulnerable.  And some of the vulnerability comes from stupidity.  So it doesn't understand, for example, that if somebody writes something in white on white  text, that's probably actually bad news.  They probably get it to conceal it from your system, right?  They don't really understand that.  And, you know, people will add band-aids to this and to that.  But there's so many ways to attack and coach up.  If you're talking about my code, because I write a video game to amuse my kids, probably  Nobody's gonna go after me.  But if you're talking about defense department stuff,  or whatever, then somebody wants to get in,  they're gonna be able to find many ways to get in.  I mean, it's already the state of cybersecurity  as you well know is not great,  that it's gonna get much, much worse.  There's all of that.  Yeah, I mean, you mentioned agents,  but I'm assuming you're also doing about vlog coding.  That's what we're talking about.  So the vlog coding uses it.  So, I mean, vlog coding is basically subject to this,  people use different tools.  And when they're doing this vlog coding stuff  that got some agent in the background  with some degree of autonomy.  One of the things that was mentioned in the video talk was  there's actually something you can switch off  called auto install or I figure what is,  what the name of the option is.  But basically you have the system right code  and like if it's a package it downloads,  it runs the code for you.  And that's probably the worst thing.  And now like the people making vibe coding platforms  are like at least giving you an option to turn it off  or maybe free or all company.  But what happens is a little bit,  we're in Vegas, it's a little bit like slot machines.  is people will just keep pulling the handle  and they're just gonna keep looking.  So even if that option is switched off,  they're gonna get a lot of like,  do you wanna install this package?  And their eyes are gonna glaze over,  they wanna move fast  cause the, you know, coders get rewarded for how much code  they're gonna end up installing these packages  anyway, whether it's auto installed or not.  And it's when you install code from the outside  that you don't understand.  There was another example where there was code in a comment  And it was like hidden to the right of the screen.  And so like the user's not even gonna notice this code  off of the right of screen.  They're looking here and it's over there.  Like so much stuff is gonna filter in.  And yes, a lot of that is in the vibe coding context.  Yeah, I mean, it just seems amazing that they wanna give  so much power to agents to run our lives.  And it's not gonna actually just question, right?  We're just not ready for that.  Yeah.  It's something we should aspire to, I suppose.  Like, you know, someday we will want that.  I mean, just like, you know, instead of hiring somebody,  If I can just do this and say, it's money, maybe it's faster, I don't have to worry about  what time zone they're in.  Like the reason is why you might want this.  But the problem is the only way we know how to build these things right now is with  LLMs.  And large language models are inherently flawed.  They hallucinate and make weird errors of reasoning.  I mean, imagine if they hallucinate code.  And in fact, some people are looking into that as a vulnerability.  Like you can guess what the hallucinations will be.  Instead of putting the offending code in the clear, you put code that's similar enough  that there will be a loose nation that will be the thing that you want.  How are you going to defend against that?  We don't know how to do it.  You would need very smart systems that are much more reliable than what we have to really  underwrite the agents that people want right now.  So we're getting like a sneak preview of the future, but it'd be like getting a sneak  preview of a car in 1850 and one in four of them blows up in your face.  It's like, we should probably wait on that.  Let somebody else test drive those things and they'll learn the gasoline.  lean is explosive and that maybe you shouldn't be in the vehicle when you fuel it and  stuff like that, which like people that should learn in boats.  We're such early days and there are dangers and the dangers here are not that anybody's  directly going to die, but people may indirectly die because you have bad code that controls  an electrical grid or nuclear grid or whatever.  And then databases are getting deleted or they get rewritten with who knows what or information  will travel to our enemies and so forth.  There are a lot of real dangers, even if it's not a perfect analogy to a car explosion.  There are going to be lots of problems.  You mentioned the word hallucinations.  Didn't you mention that in your book?  Yeah, I actually think I kind of came up with the idea of hallucination.  This is my 2001 book, The Algebraic Mind.  I really think I laid out most of what we're facing right now in terms of what are the  challenges to a neural network approach.  I was working with earlier neural networks in my dissertation.  This kind of grew out of my dissertation.  My dissertation was about eight years earlier.  a grew out of explorations of the neural networks  that people were building back in those days.  And I did experiments on them and found kind of problems  with them.  And there's this one little passage  that really anticipated hallucinations.  I gave this example of my honest or winning the lottery.  Or I wish that she had.  But so the hypothetical my honest or wins the lottery.  And then I teach that to this neural network.  But the neural network erroneously generalized  the winning of the lottery to 11 of the remaining 15 people  that sort of shared some properties with my answer.  And so I went on to say, this kind of overgeneralization  is the inevitable downside of the kind of automatic  generalization that we're talking about here.  That was basically in 2001, pointing out  the problem of hallucinations and saying it's inevitable  and as long as we're doing this and not something else  and we can talk about with the something else.  Yeah, I'd like you to, because the question is like,  why do LLM solution at?  So they lose any because of what I'm talking about.  Automatic overgeneralization, I guess I haven't  spelled it out clearly enough.  But what they were doing and what we still do  is we have what we call distributed representation.  So instead of having a single database record,  let's say, for each individual person  and then facts about those people,  what neural networks do,  and it helps them when it helps them,  but it hurts them when it hurts them, so it's be,  is it breaks all the information  into little bits of information.  So in this particular system, there was no unique node  for my on-distor, but rather on-distor is coded  as the properties that she shares with other people.  So things weren't a little differently now,  but we talk about embeddings and embedding spaces  and so forth.  And so what you'll find is like a bunch of people  that share properties are put in a similar place.  And then the system guesses that things that might be true  of that cluster of people might be true in general.  In a recent substock, I talked about my friend Harry Shearer,  who you might know, it is a voice for about the Simpsons  character, and he was the bass player in the Simpsons,  and he's been in a bunch of movies.  He's been in a bunch of movies, for example,  with Christopher Guest, who's also in Spinal Tap and so forth.  And so the system, somebody sent a biography to Harry, which he sent to me, said that Harry  Shearer was a British entertainer, voice actor, etc.  But he's not.  He's American.  He's born in Los Angeles and so he thought this was funny.  Then it went on to say that he was in the mood or he helped do voices for Jaws, which  he didn't really do.  And it said a bunch of things were true.  It got the name of his character wrong.  And so like, some of it was true.  You had a chicken, right?  Well, there's a story about me and somebody sent me a biography of me.  I don't sit there asking for biographies from J.P.T. because I think they're worthless,  but somebody else did a biography of me.  They said to me, and it said that I own a pet chicken named Henrietta.  I don't own a pet chicken.  If I did, I wouldn't call it Henrietta.  So this has become kind of a running joke.  And in fact, that's why Harry sheers entered me.  In fact, his title line before he passed someone else's message with the biography was no  Henrietta, but still that's what Harry wrote in his message.  alluding to my famous hallucinatory chicken name Henry.  So this has been a consistent problem going back to 2001.  What really kind of irritates me about the kind of high P people in this field is they're  always saying, yeah, wait till next year.  We'll solve it next year.  I'm like, dude, you've been telling me that for a quarter century and your approach does  not work.  It still has this problem.  Today's models did a little better on some benchmarks with hallucinations, but it's still  like 3%.  I mean, like making stuff up like one in 30 times is really not good stuff that you can easily get  out of Wikipedia and databases. I mean, we're not talking about making stuff up in some,  you know, really obscure thing, but also if you're making it up, you should say so, right? A good  AI system in this comes back to agents should say what it doesn't understand. And so it should  either say Harry Schreier was born in Los Angeles, which is not hard to find, right? You can find  that in Wikipedia on the front page of his entry, the first page of his entry.  Like either it should give you that or at least it should say, I don't know, which it's  say for some reason I feel like telling you London, but I can't bear that out.  Everybody imagines LLMs to be intelligent like other humans.  And you're not.  They're doing something different.  They're doing autocomplete, actually, coin the phrase autocomplete on steroids a number  of years ago.  They're doing autocomplete on steroids.  And that's just what they do.  they don't do fact checking. You know, they can't get a job in the New York or doing fact checking.  That's not what they do.  Artificial intelligence, it's supposed to be some kind of intelligence, but AI is on  intelligence. Is that right to say?  That's a definition old thing. So, you know, you could say that a chess computer, although  actually, I don't know about GPT five, but O3 is still has problems with tests we'll get to in  the second maybe. You could say a chess computer has a measure of intelligence because you could say  intelligence is multi-dimensional. There are many aspects of it. One is being able to do  the raw calculation in chess. And Gary Kasparov was really good at chess. He can do a lot of  other things too. He was really good at politics as well. But a chess computer has a piece of  intelligence. I would say no chess computer, even the one that beat Gary Kasparov is remotely  as intelligent as Kasparov, because Kasparov has this flexibility in how he can reason and think,  and so forth. I actually have a podcast coming out with him any day. And you know, he can, we  talked as fluently about politics as we did about AI and as we could have about chas and you know,  we did talk a little bit about chess. You know, his mind is versatile and not everybody is  Gary Kesparo. In fact, nobody is Gary Kesparo. But even the average human being can actually  fluidly think a lot about a lot of things. So for example, they might go to a Harry Potter movie,  read a Harry Potter book and say, oh, there's this thing called quidditch. And then they can learn  about it, even though it doesn't happen in our world, you know, you don't have a lot of experience  with quidditch before you watch or see Harry Potter because it's not a real world thing, but you  start to understand, okay, well, they're flying around on the broomsticks and this might be  possible. And this might, you know, if I said, could you fly the broomstick in one minute from  England to the United States? You'd say, no, you know, you can start to reason about it,  even though it's a domain that's not familiar. And the current system to have a lot of trouble  doing that. They might be able to do it with quidditch because there's enough data about it.  But if we came up with some other novel thing, they're going to have trouble with it.  So I mean, will all of them ever stop hallucinating? Because you said there's another way to do  it perhaps or something. Well, I think what we have to do, let's say, set them aside. I think I  want to have some value of the really good at learning statistical distributions. And that's  very useful, but they're not good at learning abstractions. They're not good at representing  particular individual bits of information in a reliable way. Like where is Harry Shearer from?  Yeah. Yeah. Now your listeners having heard me say it a few times can probably say Los Angeles,  right? The system can't reliably do that from, you know, even like one of the reasons they use  Harry Shearer is an example is he's famous, right? You know, he's he's not as famous as Dom Trump,  but he's pretty well known. And so there are many entries about him. There's Wikipedia and then  IMDB and, you know, he's been in any number of like profiles and this sort of says a lot of data  there and still it doesn't stick. I meant to talk to you about chess. By the way, which is these models get trained on  just they see lots of games. They see the rules of just a download sites like chest.com that you know,  teach you. And you can ask them a question like can a queen jump over a night and they'll say no and then in the  course of a game they'll actually have a queen jump over a night. So they don't know what's an illegal move. Right? You know, they've been told it.  They can have it an explicit knowledge, but they can't act on it. And that's, you know, this is the same problem  I was talking about with the agent.  You can say right secure code, but they can't really act on that.  Yeah, because I mean, you say it's like a, it's order compute on steroids.  It doesn't.  It doesn't seem to have intelligence and what it's doing.  Again, like just nail that down.  So there are aspects of intelligence that you could say that, but it's certainly not like  a complete thorough intelligence.  It's like, it's almost like we don't really use this term as much anymore, but in  the idiots of on that can like tell you what day a certain calendar day is, which by the way,  when these systems just messed up, a friend might ask what they like September 4th would be  in and get the cut the wrong day, what day, the weekend got wrong.  But so like in it, it's a fun, they can do certain things really well.  In particular, statistical prediction of what is likely in a context, they do extremely well,  but there are other things like fact checking that they can't do it all.  And you would expect a real intelligence to be able or a robust intelligence, let's say,  to do it. So you could say, you know, it's sort of like a bullshitter in, you know,  bar with, you know, sophomore in college trying to fake their way through things. Like, it  can convince the uninitiated, but you know, like anybody who looks in their field of expertise  looks at it and is like, well, when it talks to me about physics, it doesn't really  know about physics. And we have this illusion, well, I don't know any physics, it looks  pretty good to me, but you ask an expert in the experts, like, no, it doesn't actually  understand because it can pair it back a bunch of things that are there.  And they can train them on massive numbers of problems.  So it can solve problems of certain sorts.  But the flexibility and generality of human intelligence, they really lack.  So are we going to see this diminishing returns?  Because I mean, come to you, they're spending huge amounts of money  throwing GPUs, data, whatever, at these things.  Is it we're not going to get this masses spring forward?  Like we were supposed to get with GPT-5?  We were already getting diminishing returns.  And so, you know, GPT-5 is better than GPT-4,  but it's not massively better.  It's measurably better, I would say.  But it's not massively better.  We are seeing a moment of diminishing returns.  We're finding other techniques might help.  One of which is to add classic symbolic techniques.  So the whole history of AI has been  that the neural network people and the symbolic people  basically hate each other.  Can you explain that?  Give us some details about that.  Go on, sir.  Yeah. So the neural networks are what's popular right now.  Now, they try to break bits of information  into tiny little bits, get lots of statistical information,  into things like autocomplete.  The symbolic stuff looks more like classical computer programs,  like algebra, like logic, and we use those for certain things,  like GPS navigation systems, use symbolic AI all the time  and use it very effectively.  Because of fights over resources, like graduate students  and funding and stuff like that,  the two groups have been really hostile to one another.  And what I called for in this book,  the algebraic mind.  The subtitle was integrating connectionism  and cognitive science.  Connectionism and neural network  and cognitive science was more  of the classic, similar manipulation stuff.  That's what we need is some reconciliation,  which I've been begging the field to do for 25 years  and a little bit of it is kind of sneaking  in the back door right now.  They're starting to add some symbolic stuff  into the large language models,  which I think is a little bit too little too late,  but that's where the progress  that they're actually getting is coming from.  So Gary, we had Blackhead again.  I look at this from a sub security point of view.  But what about AI safety?  What can you tell us about that?  I mean, obviously, the related notions.  So cybersecurity is really about like,  is your code secure, can somebody steal it,  can somebody control it?  And there's like a commercial version of that.  And then there's like a humanity version of that,  which is like, is our species safe  from what can be done with these systems?  And there are different aspects.  So for example, can these systems teach somebody  had to build a biological weapon.  Somebody who couldn't otherwise do it,  teach them beyond what they could get from Google.  And so forth.  And the answer increasingly looks like it might be yes.  There are these fears of so-called rogue AI.  My view is we've made a lot more progress,  not on artificial general intelligence,  but at least some usable stuff,  what we can do with the auto-complete on steroids  and so forth.  We've made real progress there, but on what we call  alignment, getting the machine to do what we want to do,  not so much, like hallucinations and example.  Apple actually had in their system problem about a year ago.  Maybe still do.  Told the systems, be truthful, don't make stuff up.  Don't hallucinate.  And then they did anyway.  That's a simple version of alignment.  I'm going to tell you, don't make stuff up.  And I could tell that to an intern working for me and employ.  And if I told that to an employee who was working for me  and they kept doing it, they'd be gone.  Exactly.  But LLMs instead of being gone, we're  giving them another $500 billion in funding.  It's kind of insane.  If you can't tell the system, don't hallucinate.  What about like, don't cause harm to humans?  Can you really get a system to understand that?  And the answer is no.  And there's been no major progress on that problem in, I don't know, quarter century.  You could argue that the biggest progress was made by Isaac Asimov led in the 1950s when  he proposed knowing that they weren't all that great.  Asimov's laws, what we call it, you know, maybe he called them the three laws of robotics.  They weren't that great because they don't cover all the situations and so forth.  And that was part of the point of his stories is like this is actually hard, but at least  he raised the question of like what ethical principles would you instill a machine?  He raised the right question.  That's mouth did.  We still don't have an answer either to what you should actually code in, which is hard  and you know, their cultural issues and so forth.  But we don't have an answer to that.  And we don't have an answer to how to do that, right?  And you know, bunch of people have worked on that, but they're all working on the LLM context.  My view is, LOMs are too thick.  They'd not semantically rich enough to be able to understand such concepts.  So another way to put all of this is, LOMs are black boxes.  We put a bunch of data in and we get something out and we hope for the best.  That's basically how it works.  We want to run around the world on that.  We should not run the world and hope for the best.  We should really be building white box AI where we understand what's in it so that we can  debug it.  Right? We radically shifted to this black box way of doing this.  Now we're writing code.  Vibe coding is mostly at some level black box code.  It's not literally because you can actually at least see its output.  But from the perspective of many users, it basically is a black.  They don't understand the code that they've written or that they've had a  machine right.  And the LLMs themselves are black boxes.  And it's just not really working when it comes to safety.  It may be working with respect to making money.  even there, the only person really making money is Jensen Huang and his, you know,  his company and video, right? Selling chips, but you know, the analogy at which many people  views at this point is it's like selling shovels in the gold rush. You know, Jensen selling  the shovels, he makes a great shovel. They, you know, they work really well. There's a wonderful  ecosystem around them. He's a great manager, the company. Everything about the company  is great. But the problem is that the people buying this stuff don't actually know how to  to make money from it.  None of them are almost none of them  have actually made any profits.  And that's partly because the stuff is unreliable.  So do you see it just continuing like this?  Are we gonna hit a wall somewhere?  Have we hit a wall?  Well, I wrote a paper in 2022,  saying deep learning is hitting a wall.  And the point of it was that we couldn't just  keep scaling pre-training data.  And in fact, that has proven to be correct.  Part of the argument was not that we would make no progress  at all, but that we would keep running into the same problems,  which were hallucinations and problems with reasoning  and misuse for misinformation and so forth.  And we're still seeing those same obstacles.  You know, maybe I chose the wrong metaphor there  because you can always say,  well, I made progress over here,  but the fact is on the critical dimensions  of how you would make things like reliable agents,  you've not made them as progress.  And I mean, I spoke to someone who promised AGI this year,  what you're taking AGI for when?  Yeah, or is it gonna ever happen?  Or is it reality?  Is it just a...  It'll happen.  You know, there's no principle reason.  It's really an architectural problem. We have a wrong architecture and we don't know how long it will take to find the right architecture.  It's very unlikely that we're going to see AGI in the next couple of years just by doing more of the same.  It's just not really working. I mean, it works a bit, but it's not really getting a stage.  Yeah, it's possible we can get there in five years. It's a relatively long time with this many people doing research and so forth.  You know, it's more likely we get there in 10 years and you know, it's very likely we'll get there in 100 years, but we don't know exactly when.  exactly when.  I'm just going to say I heard the Google talk about something slightly different to that.  I don't think it was Google.  I think it was actually Mustafa at Microsoft.  Okay.  I actually talked about a very similar idea a long time ago, which was point-to-listic  AI, I think like five years ago.  And then Ethan Mollock turned it to Jagged Intelligence and then I think Mustafa borrowed  it.  Nobody getting attribution a long line.  But the idea is that these systems get problems that are, well, my version of the idea is  they get problems that are close to what they've been trained on, but you move further away  and they're less reliable.  And so they are jagged or pointy-listic in the sense of like, they get some of the points,  but not others and you don't really know in advance whether it's going to work.  One of the insane things about this current era is compared to the era of calculators and  spreadsheets.  Calculators and spreadsheets, if you pose the problem correctly, you will get a correct  answer.  you can leave something out in a spreadsheet your formula can be wrong. That's on you. It's not on  the system. Excel will calculate what you tell it to calculate. My pocket calculator will tell you.  A slide rule never hallucinated, not once. I have, you know, it's too young to use them much,  but I did learn how to use them. That is not true of this class of AI products. It's also  not necessary for all AI. So GPS systems don't like invent streets. We're here on the  On the Vegas strip, they don't make an alternate version of the street that goes like the  Lombard Street in San Francisco.  I mean, they just don't do that.  Exactly.  You know, classical AI does not make stuff up.  We're steeped in this crazy paradigm where we're pretending, really, linking.  Hey, we don't mind if we just make stuff up.  But it can't last.  Yeah, I mean, that's one exhibition.  It's like, where do you see this going in the next few years?  Just more money thrown at it.  What do you think is going to happen?  What's your predictions?  I mean, the most famous stock advice that I ever got,  and I don't really play the market,  was the market can stay irrational longer  than you can remain solvent.  So why am I not shorting all of this stuff?  It's because I don't know how long the delusions will last.  I mean, you could have looked at tulips  and said back in the day and said,  the list is insane, but you don't know when people  are gonna stop spending $7,000 on one tool up  or whatever.  And so it's hard from the outside to know that, in fact, if you look at my track record  or predictions on technical stuff, I've been damn near perfect.  It'd be really, really good on the rationality of the market.  I've been not so good.  So I didn't think Open AI was going to get to a $300 billion valuation.  I was wrong about that.  I don't think it deserves it, but it's much harder to predict what other people are  going to believe the marketing hype and whatever.  So I don't know.  One possible outcome is people look today at GPC5  and they're like, fuck, that is not AGI.  You know, Sam has been telling us  we know how to build AGI for years.  This just isn't AGI, it's nice, it's handy,  I'm glad it's cheaper, I'll use it.  But it's not AGI.  We're not gonna get to AGI next year.  Probably not gonna save as much money for various workplaces  as we thought.  Maybe it doesn't make sense to put in all this money.  And like tomorrow in video could crash.  People could look at that and say,  This was a really disappointing thing, but they probably won't.  You know, they probably just be like, okay, let's buy some, you know, people are going to use this.  Let's sell more Chet.  And like, I can't predict the human psychology and it's really the mass psychology part of how long people are going to stick to this bet.  At some point, they have to stop doing.  You can't just do like what Elon just did and you 100 acts every time your investments are like, I think I might be getting my money from it.  I think Grok 4 is 100 times the size of Grok 2.  So what is, you know, is Grock six going to be 10,000 times as big?  Like we don't have enough power and water on the planet to feel it.  Like at some point this has to run out, but I don't know what day that's going to be.  And technically, what do you think?  Technically, technically, you say you bet at the technical predictions.  Oh, I mean, I've made many.  So I predicted that hallucinations wouldn't go anywhere.  I predicted that GPT-5 would take much longer than people thought that it would and it did.  I predicted that, you know, reasoning errors would not be solved immediately and they didn't.  And I have an assay people can read called 25 predictions for 2025.  And they're almost all on target.  They're like 22 of them or 21 of them are on target so far.  And that reviews also some of the earlier predictions I made.  Like I predicted that there wouldn't be much technical note because it would be diminishing  returns because everybody would sort of converge on roughly the same place and that has  happened.  So, you know, there may be many predictions that have been correct over the years.  one prediction, one technical prediction that because people not might not have read that.  Well, I mean, the one that I made that I'm in some ways most proud of is 25 years of predicting  that illusinations are not going to go away if you just use this art.  Kind of.  I've been correct for quarter century on that.  And to be correct for a quarter century in AI is a pretty remarkable thing.  Gary, thanks so much.  We, out of time, I'm getting chased any lost words before we wrap up.  Well, those of you who are watching this in the cybersecurity world, you have to pay  enormous attention to prompt injection attacks.  They're gonna, I think ultimately clips everything else you've ever dealt with.  Everything you know and have learned about is gonna be helpful,  but this is gonna be a massive problem where you need all hands on that.  It's gonna be really huge.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, man.  Appreciate it."

  "transcript": " You're listening to an art media podcast.  What really happened is that Israel paid a very heavy price for an incredibly stupid  and to some extent cruel mistake it made back in March.  And Hamas was using it.  And now the question is will military pressure lead to a deal or will it lead to more criticism  of Israel that could actually lead to lose the war?  kill the hostages or will it push Hamas again to the negotiating table?  And I have, and this is the good news I'm going to end with,  the last 48 hours we're seeing assessments in Israel by intelligence sources  and by others that there is movement as to a deal.  It's 4 p.m. on Sunday, August 17th here in New York City.  It's 11 p.m. on Sunday, August 17th in Israel,  where Israelis end the day of mass protests and a nationwide strike against the government's  decision to expand the Gaza war by conquering Gaza city.  About one million Israelis participated in the strike, which was organized by the October  Council, which represents most families of hostages as well as fallen IDF soldiers.  While this sounds like a large number, and it did include hundreds of local authorities,  businesses, universities and other organizations, it failed to shut down Israel's economy.  But by the evening, demonstrations across the country, but mainly in Tel Aviv reached what  the organizers estimated to be one of the largest demonstrations in Israel's history.  Nearly 500,000 people gathered in hostage square in Tel Aviv for mass rally tonight demanding  the government reach a deal.  Again, that is according to the organizers of these rallies and strikes.  At the same time, the IDF is preparing to execute the government's decision to take over  Gaza City, despite many concerns from within the IDF about the plan.  Israel announced Sunday that it will resume the supply of tents and shelter equipment ahead  of its plan to evacuate the roughly 1 million Palestinians living in Gaza City.  Meanwhile Hamas negotiators in Cairo signaled this week that they are willing to back down  from demands that led to the collapse of the negotiations.  Israeli officials responded that the government will not go for another partial hostage  deal and will only consider for going the Gaza City takeover if Hamas agrees to all Israeli  demands for ending the war.  Also I want to take a moment to acknowledge that this Tuesday, August 19th, which is the  25th of Av in the Hebrew calendar, the family of Hirsch Goldberg Poland will commemorate  his first yard site, which is the Oscarra or first annual memorial of his passing, along with  five other hostages. It is hard to believe it has already been one year. Joining us today to  discuss Israel's plans for the Gaza City takeover and whether the operation could be thwarted by  another hostage deal is Arc Media contributor and senior analyst at Iriot Ahranot Nadavayo.  This is coming back.  Let's have a good to see you.  Good to see you again, Dan.  And you know, you just mentioned here, Scott bit pollen and I was reminded by all levy.  All levy was of course a hostel Jim self.  And when he returned back from his captivity, he told John and Rachel, the parents of  hearish, how on day 52, if I remember correctly, he knew the exact day.  called Pauline quoted the sentence to him that I think originates with Victor Frankl's book  after the Holocaust. He who has a why can bear with any how and or levy said how the sentence  he thinks kept him alive through captivity the sentence that hearish told him and he actually  has a tattoo on his arm with that sentence. Yeah and Rachel told me that they had heard,  I think I have this right that this became a line that other hostages inspired by this conversation  that you're describing that her shad other hostages then as this commandment if you will,  the Victor Franco commandment that hersh quoted became a line that they all used,  many of the hostages used with one another to just keep reminding themselves how to mentally  and emotionally get through their captivity. In many respects, they say it helped keep them saying.  Yeah, absolutely. And this goes to the demonstrations and the day of protest that we're seeing today in  Israel with people demanding to get a deal to make this the first priority. I'm not going to present  this as something that isn't discussed within the Israeli society. It's not a consensus anymore.  There is criticism coming from the government from some other postage families, not the majority  to you of them as to these demonstrations. But what they're saying is this is the number  one priority and it should be prioritized right now.  Yeah. Agena is important to acknowledge what the criticisms coming from some among the  hostage families and your point may very well be the minority is that right now when it  seems that Israel is headed for a hostage deal, the protests, you know, can strengthen  a mass is negotiating position. I'm not saying this is my view. I'm just saying this is  this is some of the rhetoric you're hearing.  Yeah, the Prime Minister Netanyahu basically said that this morning in Israel.  Okay, Nadav, before we dive into the topic of our conversation today,  can you tell us about the news you broke over the weekend about China's plan to rebuild Iran's missile capabilities?  Yeah, so basically, first element is that the reconstruction of the nuclear program has somewhat been sidelined by the Iranian regime.  This goes to the discussion as to what extent of damages that they suffer at the attack made by Israel and United States.  And the answer is that the damage is so substantial then that they have basically sidelined the idea of rebuilding their nuclear program at this point.  And now they have other issues at hand that are critical for them.  And I think first and foremost is building their error defenses.  And it was already published that they're negotiating with China to get some sorts of error defenses that are equivalent of the S 400.  The Russians S 400.  And I think that the reason that they're turning to the Chinese is because the Russians will not supply them some of these weapons,  which is a very interesting development as of itself.  Well, can we just say one moment, just a minute on the importance of the S 400s,  because those are the kinds of air defenses that Iran was so dependent on that Israel had basically  between April of 24, October of 24, the volley back and forth between Israel and Iran and then obviously  June of 25, when you add all of those up, these air defenses were largely wiped out, which is when  we talk so loosely that Israel has complete air superiority over Iran. It was because these systems  had been taken out, right? The Iranians had some sort of triad's made with the S 400 Russians S 400,  but they didn't have a formal agreement with Russians to supply it.  And massively they had mainly the S-300 which has a decreased capability.  It doesn't really matter because now they're negotiating with the Chinese as to their  air defenses. Now, what the Iranians understand is what Israel and the  Sir Wright in the beginning, and it was trying to send that message back  in its own attack, which was very specific. October of 2024,  after the Iranians attacked Israel, I remind our listeners that Israel had a very direct  attack to a specific site. And we talked about this on this program that this was sending a message  to the Iranian regime that we can take your air defenses out if we want to. And Israel actually  took out a lot of its air defenses of the Iranians air defenses. Well, they didn't get the memo.  And what Israel did during the war in June of 25 is basically take out all the air defenses,  all the important air defenses of the Iranians. And they became completely naked to any Israeli  attack from the air. It'll be natural to deduct that this is the first thing for them to rebuild.  What I've added during the weekend is that it's not about the air defenses alone.  It's to an extent mostly about the abilities of the Iranians to have ballistic missile  capability and to scale it up massively using the Chinese.  And the intelligence services in the West are very worried because of the relationship  between Beijing and Tehran becoming closer and closer.  And people who have heard, for instance, the speech is made by the Trump administration,  only by the Israelis know that what Israel understood in the Trump administration and the  sort of the search point is that those ballistic missiles completely conventional are as a  big threat strategically speaking to the state of Israel's existence as the nuclear program,  simply because Israel is such a small country. Now, if the Chinese indeed are going to somehow,  There are two ways to do this. You can supply ready-made ballistic missiles and launchers,  or you can start building them in Iran. But whatever method they're going to do,  if they are going to allow the Iranians to re-acquire their ability and expand it in scale,  that's going to be a big issue for Israel and potentially for the Europeans and for the United States.  Now secondly, Israel has sent messages to Beijing.  And a senior Israeli source, I spoke with, an official told me that Beijing has not confirmed  to Jerusalem, that it is indeed going to do that.  And that the intentions of Beijing be made unclear, but this could have strategic repercussions  mainly because, as you know, for the United States, specifically the Trump administration,  China is indeed the main strategic rival.  And Jerusalem is sending a warning sign here  to China to the extent that, you know,  the small Israel can warn China to say,  we know that you're considering this,  that you might be signing these agreements.  Please don't do that.  What does this show you about what Iran  learned from its war with Israel?  Well, first of all, it says that the Iranians are there.  I'll just give you another example  to what extent they are there.  They just sent an emissary to Lebanon to meet all the sites in Lebanon.  He was humiliated and Lebanon.  I'm talking about Ali Larry Gianni,  who's the secretary of their National Security Council.  He was humiliated by the president,  the prime minister, lectured by them,  not to intervene.  I've left it out.  I've left it out.  Yeah.  Lectured by them not to intervene with Lebanese issues,  which is something unheard of,  like two years ago, a few years ago,  because they were running the show in Lebanon.  Well, no longer for them.  It was not heard of a year ago.  Yeah.  He was basically told, go back home.  At the same time, let me say something  that people don't understand.  Iran, after the war in Lebanon,  diverted a billion dollars,  a billion dollars to the reconstruction in Lebanon  and to paying families of Hezbollah in Lebanon.  And the response of getting from the Lebanese system is,  we don't want you to be part of the Lebanese scene,  but this gives you an impression to your question  that the Iranians are very much intended right now  to start and reconstruct their national and regional security.  And they're not done.  And people who know Iran, experts of Iran have always said,  when you have this regime there,  they're not gonna rethink, regroup and say,  let's focus on Iranian economy.  We just lost $100 billion in this fantasy  about a wall of fire around Israel?  No, no, no.  They want their regional cloud.  They believe it's important for their regional security  as the only Shia state in the world.  And because of that, they're gonna rebuild.  And this is what they're beginning to do.  If that door in Moscow remains closed right now,  I remind our listeners that President Putin  has basically said, hey, why won't you enrich your uranium  somewhere else?  Which is basically the Trump administration position.  I think this is the only issue in which  President Putin has adopted the Trump administration  position as to the enrichment of Iranian uranium.  At the same time that Dorne Moscow closes, we're going to try and open the door with the Chinese.  But this is becoming more interesting in the sense of how the superpowers can get sucked into the  conflict in the Middle East. And also, we all know that one of the reasons that the Biden administration  wanted to go through making the relationship with Saudi Arabia more robust is fearing more Chinese  influence in the Middle East. Okay. Let's turn to Gaza. What's the latest you can tell us in  in terms of the idea of plans for going in  take over Gaza City.  So in the next 24 hours, I expect that the idea of chiefs  of staff are going to have a session.  And in that session to start looking at confirming  their tactical operational program to capture Gaza City.  That's an incredibly complex operational assignment.  And let me quote one, Israeli general.  Gaza is the most complex problem that the IDF has faced since its inception in 1948.  You have a very dense populated area.  You have an entrenched terror army that has become during the war, a guerrilla organization,  very much supported by the local population in a very dense and condensed area.  And a guerrilla army that uses this population to protect it rather than the other way around.  Of course, Hamas, definitely, I don't think anyone thinks differently.  I never heard any pushback from when I go on international media and say, Hamas doesn't  care about the local population.  Even Israel's fiercest critics don't go, no, they do care about, that's just demonizing.  Nobody says that they don't care about the local population and you have hostages there  and you have the international community.  According to international law, you are supposed to enable the transfer of aid and food  to the local population during the war.  And the idea of the state of Israel have said that they are committed to enabling aid going  into Gaza.  And all of these factors together make Gaza such a complex problem.  Now, you know, this statement, just look at the last two years then, we had this arch-enemy  called Iran, Israel basically crashed their abilities in 12 days. We had the arch-enemy  called Hezbollah, Israel crashed their abilities about a year, a year and a few months.  Israel is still trying to get over the Gaza problem. And I know speaking with my American  friends, many, many people are asking me, you know, what is Israel trying to do in Gaza?  They feel extremely frustrated and they have no good answers right now. And even that  plan that we're going to discuss about taking or capturing somehow guys a city. The way that the  idea of his planning it is going to be so careful, we're not going to wake up after 10 days and say,  wow, you know, nobody thinks in the idea that Hamas is going to surrender their bunkers and we see  hundreds of armed men go out and surrendering the hostages. There is no scenario that I know of  right now in the IDF, that's things that this is going to go to that. Or that you have an  operation, a brilliant operation that will lead to that.  Okay. So I want to talk about the differences between how the IDF would recommend approaching  this Gaza city operation and how the security cabinet wanted the idea of to approach this  operation and what they settled on before I do. One argument that could be made is that if  Gaza city is like the Berlin of Hamas's Germany or the Moscow of Hamas's Russia,  But, you know, up to this point has been untouched.  And if Hamas was sensing that pressure was mounting on Israel and not mounting on Hamas  over the last month or two with the quote unquote food, the mass starvation charges against  Israel, the recognition of the Palestinian state by all these governments or statements  that they will recognize the Palestinian state by all these governments in Europe, there's  just all this pressure mounting on Israel that sort of had Israel on its back foot.  And Hamas wouldn't negotiate.  could argue that Israel saying we're going into Gaza city, this stronghold of Hamas that has  been untouched up to this point. And we will take it in that, in and of itself will bring  Hamas back to the table. I mean, that regardless of what you think of the military viability  of the plans, which we'll get into, there is a negotiation impact here as it relates to  hostage negotiations.  Absolutely. If Hamas really believes that you're going to take Gaza city and also then  The question remains, let's say Israel Tatsa,  all the problems that we're going to discuss  are going to be sold and Israel is going to do that,  even brilliantly in a way that local population  is to some extent protected, that the casualty rate  is lower than the idea of expected and so forth.  OK, and then what Hamas exists in the central camps  of the Gaza Strip that places like Nousirah to Viral Balah.  exists in the humanitarian areas like the Mwasi and other areas.  So, you know, what's the distress there? The answer is that in order to conduct this kind of  an operation in Gaza city, you need to lead to the evacuation of 1.2 million people. Just in order  not to hurt too many people in the process. One thing about Gaza city that people don't understand is  This first of all, that a lot of the Gaza population has basically fled into Gaza city.  So now it's about 1.2 million people living in that city.  These are apartment buildings with sometimes three or four or five floors.  It's a heavily populated urban area.  Think about troops going into this area.  Think about tanks rolling into these areas.  Now, some parts of Gaza city were taken right at the beginning of the war.  the square in Gaza city was taken right in the beginning of the war turned out that they had  a massive bunker of Hamas underneath. There are hospitals there with bunkers of Hamas.  But that's, I think, the first element there for the IDF is to try and understand how  it leads to the evacuation of the civilians so that there won't be massive, massive civilian  casualties when the IDF goes in.  And for the idea, and I need to underline this, they're very much against this plan.  The preparing the plan, and they're going to do it because they're the army and the government  makes the call and the cabinet make the decision.  But I've never heard so much resistance within the defense officials and the army to the  plan because they're saying, you know, we're not sure we can evacuate the same number of  people as we did with Rafa.  It's a completely different situation than a year ago.  the international pressure. One of the things that they're fearing then is that they'll begin  the operation as planned. And then someone, maybe in the US, maybe the White House,  we'll pick up the phone and say stop it. And then it'll be better not to begin the operation,  than to have it stopped by the US at the certain moment. Now I have as far as we know right now,  the US is giving full support to the Netanyahu cabinet with this decision. And President Trump  personally and we heard what President Trump said. I'm not analyzing here. He said,  remember October 7th, he was reacting to these issues, but President Trump also said this  week that he thinks that journalists should go into Gaza and see for themselves. So it  can change. And this is one of the things that worries the idea. Another thing that worries  the idea is and they were warned by the chief attorney of the idea that this evacuation  is only supposed to save lives of the civilian local population.  It's not an expulsion.  And it cannot be used for immigration or forced immigration  or expulsion of Palestinians or to push them out  of the Gaza Strip altogether.  What was once called the Gazan Riviera Vision  or the Benvera Smartrich dream.  If you use this to that, it's a war crime.  And the chief attorney of the Israeli army has told the chiefs of staff,  you can do that in that case.  You can, you can lead to the evacuation of the local population.  If you guarantee their return after the operation is over,  and you can only do that in order to have less casualties, civilian casualties there.  And considering the international atmosphere as to Israel,  but can I just say back to somebody who said about President Trump, I mean,  One thing that's he's been consistent about, especially in the last few weeks is,  Israel do what Israel is going to do in Gaza.  And he's not signaled a red light.  He's not signaled even a yellow light.  I'm not saying he's flashing a green light, but he's certainly not in any way  signaling that he's going to stand in the way of what the government is deciding to do.  I mean, he's been consistent on that. Yeah.  He's been consistent, but he's also been consistent on wanting to end the war down,  right. And getting those such as back wanting to end the war.  Well, I actually think I'm not in the man's head, but if you're right that he says both  of those things and he and his mind, those two may be connected that the more aggressive  Israel is in Gaza, the greater likelihood that Hamas comes back to the table, the greater  likelihood that you have a path to ending the war, whereas where Israel is now nothing is  happening.  Meaning Hamas is not coming to the negotiating table.  There's no sign that Hamas is being, you know, is kind of about to break entirely.  And so it's like the worst of all worlds.  So yes, you may want to suffer intending.  God said you may want the war to wind down and maybe the way to do it is actually to crank  up the level of aggressiveness and the intensity of the war fighting in places that Israel  hasn't fought before rather than the other.  I'm not saying, by the way, he's right or the government is right.  I'm just saying, I'm not sure those two positions that Trump articulates are irreconcilable.  The answer is to what aim is ready.  Defense officials didn't say don't do anything, right?  the IDF had planned and suggested to the cabinet  was basically not to occupy Gaza City,  but to pressure militarily and do more of the same.  I didn't hear from people in the army  that thought that this is gonna be extremely effective, okay?  But they were thinking that this could also be a disaster.  A disaster internationally, and of course it could lead  to the deaths of the hostages and the chief of staff  in the cabinet meeting in a very direct confrontation with the political level.  It's a close cabinet meeting. So he's saying his opinion, that's his job.  He said, okay, if this is the case, if this is what you want,  take out the goal of getting the hostages back from the goals of the war.  If this is what you want, don't say it's a goal of the war. And let me tell you,  Dan, why? Because if you're telling the army, there are two goals for this war,  getting the hostages back, making sure that Hamas doesn't control Gaza.  If these are the goals of the war, it's not just a statement.  It's not a PR statement. That's an order.  And if you're in the army right now and you're planning an operational plan,  you need to keep these two goals together alive.  And what the chief of staff was saying, I can't capture Gaza  the way that you're talking about capturing Gaza City  and keep the goals that you yourself have ordered me to keep.  You can't bluff about these issues. He was to an extent calling the bluff.  And that's just one example of the confrontation between the idea. Also, you need to enlist now  dozens of thousands at least of more reserve soldiers. And the idea is now after, you know,  it's the longest war ever fought in Israel's history. We're seeing post-Trauma in its peak.  we're seeing loads of units that are having trouble getting reserve soldiers to report all the  time. And because of that, the idea was pushing and still pushing very hard. If you can get a deal  now, get that deal and we'll finish the job with Hamas later. One of the arguments made by the  idea as to the hostages areas, you, the cabinet, said there are two goals. One goal, we need to get  right now, that's the hostages because they're going to die because they are being starved in Gaza.  Yeah. If you want images of forced starvation and starvation is a tool of war, you can look at the  images of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. So the argument there is one element is an element that  is very, very short lived and that is getting the hostages back. Another element which is taking  out Hamas, there's going to be a struggle of many, many years. Even if we do capture Gaza  city, we do clear Gaza city. Still, you know, you're going to have Hamas and you'll need  to have a strategic plan for many years to come. And that's the argument. Now, operationally  speaking, what was chosen by the cabinet at the end was a sort of emerge between the  approaches. But it's going to be a slow process. And I just spoke with the defense  official and he told me, you know what, you know, at the end, the difference between what the  idea of his saying and the government is saying is not that large. But we're going to get the  international criticism as though we decided the most extreme option that was discussed in a  PR notices of cabinet ministers or their interviews. And then the idea of we need to answer  and we need to react to that.  And we both need to quote the sentence,  it's a Hebrew sentence or a Jewish sentence,  to get chased out of the town  and eat the stinking fish, both of those, right?  I think it's probably a translate from Yiddish.  You know, so, and the idea says it's always the case,  you know, we're not gonna do this.  And we are gonna get criticized  as though we are doing this altogether.  But Nadaab, that is a metaphor for every phase and every stage and every development of this  war, which is that whatever caution Israel uses, whatever caution the IDF demonstrates  or exercises, Israel is still criticized for the worst characterization or worst scenario  that could have happened relative to what it's actually doing.  Yeah, that's true.  But in that cabinet meeting, that's another story.  He don't say the foreign answer, who by the way just returned to the likud after many years  and was accepted very enthusiastically in the likud.  Had a speech and that speech wasn't published too much because he didn't have these interviews  like the far right ministers trying to push the idea, yeah now let's be aggressive.  No, his speech was completely different.  He told the Israeli cabinet, look, whatever you're gonna get from this operation or this  War in general in Gaza, it doesn't equal the level of strategic and diplomatic damages  that we're incurring right now around the world. We are just after this huge strategic  success of the war against Iran. And we are being sucked to the black hole called Gaza.  And when he was speaking unlike other parts in the cabinet, very adversarial,  still, in other words, people keep shouting at each other.  But when Gidon's house spoke, even the far right ministers, nobody interrupted it.  And he was saying there is no way to compare between the damages of the lasting of the war  to Israel's position in the long term.  I think many people feel that.  By the way, many people I speak with in the US, in Europe, and talking about supporters  of Israel, about from the Jewish community and not from the Jewish community, are saying  that.  And I'm asking, on the other hand, and I'm going to present the other side of this.  you don't need to push back then. I was getting ready to push back and I appreciate you.  No, no, I want to present this because on the other hand, one could ask if Hamas enjoys the idea  of we convince the world that there is an intentional starvation of the population.  I don't think that there is an intentional starvation of the population.  I think there is hunger, at least there was hunger in Gaza. The facts that I know of are not  that the Israeli government wanted to have starvation of the Ghazan population. In its decision  between March and May 19, I think it wanted to pressure Hamas, but not go. And I think that was a  huge mistake. And I spoke about this on your show. I think they were playing with fire, humanitarian,  fire. And I think it caught fire both in terms of international media, but also in real terms.  I don't think the entire thing is fabricated. I think there is a human-time crisis in Gaza.  We were going to do a separate episode on this, but I agree with you as one would expect in any  combat war environment that there's a humanitarian crisis to some degree.  And obviously, for what you said at the beginning of this conversation where you described how  difficult war fighting in this Gaza, and that it's one of, if not the most dense  area population-dense areas in the world. That's at war. You would expect that to be the case.  But this idea that there is no mass starvation.  You mentioned COGAT.  So the coordination of government activities in the territories.  That's what COGAT is, which is like the military arm that deals with a whole range of military  issues of the IDF in the territories.  But according to COGAT, there were 66 deaths from the beginning of the war through June  of 25 due to starvation or malnutrition.  And then according to Hamas in July of 25, that number skyrocketed to 133 deaths.  And in the past, Hamas had provided the identities of those who died or the  Gaza and Health Ministry, provide the identities. And when Kogat said, well, where are  the identities? Now, you said the number skyrocketed in no time to 133 deaths  the Gaza and Health Ministry. And Hamas would not provide the identity. So  Kogat on its own went and tried to figure out the identities through news  reports or social media posts. And they only found a few deaths. And all or most  of those deaths according to Colgate were of people who had pre-existing conditions, genetic  disease, ailments. So it's not to say there's no food crisis challenges in Gaza. You  know, again, I don't want to sound like my hands are covering my eyes. There's no real  problem. Of course there's a problem. But this whole craze we've been subjected to over  the last few weeks, I at least am skeptical of and I know you've been speaking to military  resources about this too. Yeah, I have. And and this really military is now started investing  some of its prime intelligence, eight to hundred into looking at hunger and Gaza. First of all,  I should say, you know, why now we've been fighting this war for two years. The humanitarian  issue was always an issue. I'm much less forgiving in a sense than you are. I think that Israel's  decision to stop all aid and food, including baby formulas to Gaza on March 2nd that passed  underneath the radar. And I myself didn't write about enough.  But I just if you're going to say that in the dove, it's important to also say that during  the ceasefire, according to Israel, according to UN bodies, Israel had allowed something  like over six times the level of aid into Gaza that local population needed at that time.  It wasn't like they thought they were just turning off the spigot and suddenly,  God's would be depleted of aid.  There was a sense that there was a stockpiling of aid because they turbocharged a level of aid  that would last many months past the period of the season.  I don't think we should suggest that there is a just shutting shut down aid and there was overnight,  there was no aid.  I think it was terribly stupid and to some extent cruel idea and here's why,  because after almost two years of war, if you stop all aid and food to two million people during  war time and you don't tell them when the aid and the food are going to renew,  you don't need to be a humanitarian expert. You need to understand basically to be in your first  course in economy to understand that the prices of food are going to skyrocket maybe exponentially  because each day the passes you have less food and therefore the prices of  commodities are going to appreciate as you go by. But keep in mind six months of  aid was pumped in during the year but trying to assess how much people will eat.  You know if Israel wants to take control of the humanitarian issue in Gaza and  says I'm responsible for everything it's not the UN you know we're  I'm not working with the UN, I'm responsible.  Started to do that with the GHF,  but what happened is that just factually speaking,  poor families in Gaza, not only poor families in Gaza,  started paying obscene amounts of money  for one kilogram of flour.  In some parts of Gaza.  In some parts, in enclaves,  not in any charge, it's a Gaza strip.  I wanna emphasize that.  So this is an important point,  because again, there's this narrative out there  that it was all of Gaza,  and it was in even Kogat says,  it was in certain areas prices went up.  Absolutely.  And then if someone pays like $25 to $35 for a kilogram of flour and he has five miles  in his household that need to be fed, these are the prices of hunger.  This is something that people don't understand about hunger.  Hunger is always a matter of money.  People who have more money will buy food even if there's scarcity.  And this population is not being working.  There is no economy.  So to do that was irresponsible and it was because of pressure coming from far right ministers  and because of an idea that you presented that if the minutes open, first of all my approach  here is new angst.  So if the protocols of the government open, you won't see like the defense minister  is primarily saying, oh, we want them starved because it's the other way around because  Netanyahu is saying in public announcements, when he opens up on May 19, he says, we can't  have this war if the population starve. He understood this concept. By the way, this is  the concept of the Biden administration. They told this to the Israelis that right at the  beginning, if you want to find this war, you want to make sure that there is enough food  in class. Okay. You and I talked about this the other day. We can get into a whole discussion  about this. But I think it's just important to contrast with your describing with the way  This crisis was being reported in international press.  Oh, of course.  You're not gonna make me defend, you know, the New York Times photo editor.  Not just a photo editor, the headline,  Washington Post July 24th,  mass starvation stocks,  Gaza's deaths from hunger rise.  I mean, it's just, this was a flurry of headlines in virtually every  publication in the West.  So what you're describing very clinically, which I, you know,  appreciate and quibble with here and there, but is not what was projected to the  world as to what was happening. Yeah, by the way, one good example to that was the idea that  people are fainting and you know, medical staff is fainting because of lack of food. First of all,  as far as my sources are telling me, and I'm not using kogat idea of sources to that,  there is no shortage of food in medical installations still operating in the Gaza Strip.  someone actually showed me the process in which this develops.  And first you see this on Hamas channels.  Medical staff is fainting.  Then you see it on some unra groups.  Like a telegram channel?  Yeah, yeah.  Like Hamas channels are producing this.  Then you see this being echoed.  And producing what?  Making these messages.  The idea that medical staff is fainting,  then you see it being echoed on UN aid group affiliated of Palestinians in Gaza.  Then you see this finding its way to the international press.  Then you find it at the New York Times.  Again, as a journalist, I didn't check the sources of that story on the New York Times.  So maybe they did, you know, corroborate this.  They saw people, they saw pictures of medical staff.  But you know what?  There is something in this type of conversation that is minimizing what's really happening  in Gaza.  And I don't want to minimize this.  I think there is a terrible humanitarian crisis.  Why did the Israeli press start reporting about hunger in Gaza?  Because the sources of Israeli reporters reporting on Palestinian issues, speaking Arabic,  These are the most experienced people.  The talk with Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip, they started talking with their sources  that are usually enemies of Hamas.  Speaking fluent Hebrew.  And they talked with them and they started reporting on price in the Saudi saying I'm hungry.  My kids are hungry too and I've lost weight and we're eating once a day.  And that means that you might have a problem of hunger and in certain cases you had.  Now flower was probably solved, you know, I'm ending with the good news because we're  seeing now sacks of flower left unattended.  But do you want to turn in prices is still there?  But let me just say humanitarian crisis is there.  We can debate the severity of the food crisis.  But again, to me it's tragic and a completely unforced error that Israel allowed this narrative  to lock in.  I mean, even this weekend, Nick Kristoff in the New York Times has a piece about Gaza.  talks about the killing of an estimated 18,000 children and the starvation. I'm quoting  here, the starvation of a population, the starvation of a population. This is this weekend.  Even as you say things are getting better, he hyperlinks, so I clicked on the hyperlink.  And what does it take you to? The July 24th, New York Times article that says, godsens are dying,  which has now been discredited. So we may say things are getting better. We may say things  were never as bad as they were reported, but unfortunately this line about Israel and  a forced starvation on Palestinians is sticking. And this is a huge, huge problem.  But the problem wasn't only PR. The problem is that if you're saying, I'm not going to allow  food to go into Gaza, you know, naturally after Israel sent in six months worth of food.  Again, we can debate the management of it. But yes, okay. So I'm now turning to the  casino who's an expert in messaging. And I'm serious now, okay. The Israeli government  would turn to you and would say, look, we've decided to stop all food and aid into Gaza,  beginning on March 2nd, because Hamas doesn't agree to our terms to end the war.  This is basically what Israel's cabinet said.  Now you message this down in a way that it won't be starving the population.  Israel does not explain its policies, many of which I think are sensible, obviously, but  I think they do themselves enormous damage, but not explain the policy.  If they had said what we now know, which is when they put the freeze on aid in, it was just  after they had flooded Gaza with six months of aid.  They should have been messaging that to the Palestinian population.  You have six months of aid.  They should have been messaging that to the international community, but they don't do very  much messaging to the international community, which is a subject for another day.  But I'm not saying that the policy was right or wrong.  I do think it could have been contextualized.  And that said, Nadav, that doesn't absolve reporters  from not just relying on Hamas telegram channels.  Okay, there's six months worth of food in Gaza.  Let's say this is the case and they would have said that.  So what's the reason to stop the aid?  Yeah.  What did they expect would happen?  You know, this was an announcement made  if by the cabinet, I think by the prime minister,  why would you substantively do that?  if it is not to pressure Hamas.  And if you are pressuring Hamas through usage of food,  you will be accused in starving the population.  And I'm saying this to myself as a journalist  because I should have called you up then,  when this decision was made.  And I should have said, hey, then,  I think that this will just made an incredibly stupid  and potentially dangerous human-attourily speaking,  decision that's discussed.  And I didn't.  And I have to tell you, you know, I keep thinking about that  because I think that this is the type of terrible mistakes  that are made through terrible wars  of the sort that we are fighting specifically  when you're fighting this kind of enemy like Hamas.  And this is always the danger that Hamas  is gonna drag you down and to quote Gidelsar,  the Israeli Foreign Minister a week ago,  to drag you down to the black hole.  And I would say the black moral hole  the Gaza Strip. Okay, so let's take the ante. You don't start our position. Imagine in two or three  weeks from now, we're doing an episode in the dove on a new hostage deal. Will we say, will you  say, you know, the military pressure that Israel cranked up against Hamas and Gaza city,  Hamas's Berliner Moscow, the thought of losing it and losing control of it completely terrified  Hamas and they went back to the table and they realized despite all this pressure on Israel  internationally that we've experienced over the last few weeks, which Hamas thought gave them  enormous momentum to the point that they could walk away from talks on July 24th. Suddenly,  they ran back to talks because they realized they overplayed their hand. And Israel didn't care  was not worried about the pressure and was going to go take Gaza City regardless. And Hamas came  back to the table and got a deal. Will we say, will you say, you know what, this whole build up about  the operation to Gaza City served a useful purpose in bringing Hamas back to the table?  Yeah, absolutely. I will say that I am saying this today.  You know, I don't see myself as an expert for warfare or negotiating with Hamas.  What I see myself as someone who speaks with these people and what I'm hearing is constantly  the same thing from the people who want to get the hostages back. They're saying you can do this  without having some pressure on Hamas on the military level. And the problem is now, if they're honest,  is that this pressure could also lead to the deaths of hostages.  But if you will have no pressure, they're going to drag the negotiations forever,  like they did with Guidad Chali and the rest. Now, this is what I'm hearing from the professionals  there. What I'm hearing from the hostage families, and I want to give this some airtime,  is what are you talking about? And the war, get an agreement with Hamas.  Anyway, you're negotiating a ceasefire with Hamas. And then fight Hamas in another day. And this  position is not a fringe position. That's the position of the Israeli public. I just published  a JPPI poll on my column this Friday. And we keep asking more and more extreme questions. They are  asking extreme questions in their phrasing saying Hamas would remain in Gaza.  Nadav, so what is the poll say when you ask the question, if Israel does a final deal and ends  the war gets all the hostages back, again, assuming all this can happen so easily. I'm skeptical,  but let's just say it does. Hamas agrees to end the war. All the hostages return, and Israel has to  fight Hamas another day in the future. What is the polling show on that? Let's just take the JPPI poll.  So it shows that there is a majority within the Israeli public. I can pull out the numbers,  the latest numbers. Yeah, pull it up. Pull it up. I'm quoting the question from the JPP I.  Paul, the Jewish people policy institute, which is a nonprofit organization nonpartisan. Yeah.  So what's the right thing to do in Gaza? And I'm quoting, I'm translating as I go by from Hebrew.  So, you know, if you see descriptions, sees between this and English, it's because I'm translating  from Hebrew to try and get an agreement and returning the hostages. Even if this means that the goal  of deposing Hamas from the governance of Gaza has not been achieved 54% of the Israeli public.  To continue the war until all the goals that were said were achieved, meaning no Hamas governance in Gaza and all the hostages come back home, 37%.  Don't know 9% and by the way, do you support or object delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza?  The entire population supports 53%  Oppose 32% don't know 15%.  That's a JPPI poll. What was that last number? The majority number?  54% try and get an agreement on returning the hostages even if it means  that the goal of deposing Hamas from the governance in the Gaza Strip is not a cheap.  54%.  Yeah. You hear in that number a majority mathematically correct.  I hear in that almost one of every two Israelis is opposed to that.  But they were asked about the other auction is 37% then.  The other camp is much weaker than it's not like 50 50.  Okay. Bring it down to 37%.  So say almost four in every 10 Israelis.  And that's the entire population.  I'll add another argument.  And that is that if you measure how is it in the Jewish population in Israel, it's about 5050.  Right.  So I hear all the time from my friends, you included that the overwhelming majority of Israelis  want the word and even if it means Hamas stays in power, the overwhelming majority of  Israelis want the word and even if it means having to fight Hamas again.  And I'm just saying, you're right that it's a majority, but it's not overwhelming, which  Which means Israeli society is actually deeply divided on this question.  Mika Goodman made the point recently on our podcast that Israel is about to go into Gaza  city with this very intense operation while Israeli society is so divided on this question.  And his point was very hard for Israel to do what it's about to do when it's army is  exhausted when there's international backlash, like at volume level 11 against Israel and  Israeli society.  So divided that the great wars and the major military successes in Israeli history have been  when Israelis are united.  And I get that and we can debate that.  But the corollary to that is also true, making a decision to end the war, a defensive  war against an enemy that executed upon an existential threat against Israel and to leave  that entity in power, Hamas, and hope that you're going to be able to fight them again,  maybe, maybe not. Sounds eerily familiar in the past when Israel said, don't worry, if  Hamas is a problem, we'll go deal with them. And do that when a huge chunk of the population  is saying, we're not on board with that either. It's also dangerous. In other words, I  could make the mica argument. It sounds like it's your argument that you can't go do  this major military operation, but the country's so divided. That's a big decision to  to make with the country so divided.  It's also a big decision to effectively  keep Hamas in power while the country so divided on that too.  There's a huge swath of the population  that is not okay with that.  I agree.  It's a very mixed opinion and that's true.  I do think that the difference in the examples  that you just gave is that these really public  gave the government the time together  with all the supporters of Israel around the world,  including the Jewish community in America,  to get to some sort of resolution of the Gaza conflict.  Because the cost of the war to Israel is until now assessed as 330 billion  checkers. And it's a small country.  That's the reason, by the way, why modern nations lose or win wars.  And this comes together with our other elements.  For instance, the hostel element that really limits the IDF operation in Gaza.  This is something that I think people don't understand.  If I would have shown you the map of Gaza today,  where the IDF is operating,  where it isn't operating,  it aligns where you have hostages.  And again, this is because of the orders of the government,  not because the IDF is obsessed about the hostages,  but because it's the government that said,  you have two goals here.  So the IDF is trying somehow to win the war against Hamas,  while having hostages.  And the argument isn't, let's just let it go. Hamas is going to control Gaza, they're going to  rebuild. No, presenting this as a binary, I think is the mistake. The argument is sophisticated  argument that you hear right-wingers like Bennett pitching. And of course, he's a position,  he wants to be the prime minister and everything. What he's saying is, let's get the hostages back.  Let's get a deal and we're going to fight them another day and this is going to be a long war and it's  going to be a long struggle to get them not really in control of the Gaza Strip. Now all the  agreements today and we have had this conversation all the understanding in the region today,  Egypt, the UAE, even Qatar is that Hamas is not going to formally control the Gaza Strip.  The argument against this is the prime minister is saying I want Hamas also to this arm  and to the entire Gaza Strip to be completely demilitarized. I really don't  know how you can reach that in an agreement. The only way you can reach that is  with a full occupation of the Gaza Strip including having a soldier in every  street clearing every house and all the rest. So you're making a demand that even  if Hamas agrees to they're gonna cheat, they're gonna lie and it's never gonna be  met by an agreement. It doesn't make much sense and also the question is do  you agree with the SAR assessment, the Foreign Minister's assessment that whatever you're  going to get in Gaza, strategically is less important than the damages you incur right  now internationally. And what I sense from you from what you're saying is that you don't  agree. You think that we can still get something in Gaza that will be more important than  the continued damages. I have friends and friends of family that are being called up right  now for this operation. So the idea that soldiers are going to keep fighting and dying in  Gaza to me is it's unfathomable actually. I also think that those who have this abstract  notion and it feels very abstract to me of how we just end the war, how Israel just ends  the war and ends the war and brings all the hostages back and somehow Hamas's control of  Gaza ends in that process too. And oh, by the way, Hamas is disarmed in Gaza. And then  there'll be a nuisance in the future and Israel will have a basis upon which to return  and take them out. I just don't think it's going to be that simple. Hamas is smarter  than that, whatever conditions for an end to the war that they agree to are obviously  going to have this exact scenario in mind that Israel is going to try to come back to Gaza.  And I think the international community that will not want Israel to fight Hamas again in  the future under any circumstances will contribute to creating conditions that make it very  hard for Israel to take action against Hamas again.  So in that sense, Nadav, I'm sympathetic to the many Israelis reflected in that J.P.P.  I poll and not saying I agree with them on every issue.  You know, I'm just saying, but the general sentiment, I do understand that sense, like  this war was started.  We need to finish it to the extent that we can finish it and we're not going back.  We're not going to fight Hamas again.  We're not going back into Gaza again, meaning not only will we not have the will for it,  the world will not let us do it.  So this is it.  This is our shot.  I understand that sentiment.  And what I guess I'm more frustrated by is not whether or not I agree with that sentiment  or not, because I understand there's some holes in that side's argument too.  I'm just struck by the monolithic ubiquitous press coverage coming out of Israel, at least  in the English language press coverage coming out of Israel.  That presents one side of this debate as the only side that is reflective of where these  really public is.  That's what frustrates me, actually.  And I don't think that reflects reality.  I agree.  It's always the case when you have an absolute majority.  And in Israel today, you have an absolute majority that prioritizes getting the hostages  back home.  And we started with very vague questions.  There was a lot of criticism against pollsters that they were not asking the right questions.  Now they're asking the most extreme questions that are tilted the other way.  You know, because Bennett isn't saying, and we're going to allow Hamas to be there.  That's not the plan. That's not what the idea is saying.  Look down. I started speaking about the IDF and the defense officials position  that you need to end with Gaza and advance to the north and to Hezbollah.  When on your show, it's about February 2024.  Now, since then, many, many things have happened in Gaza.  They were essential.  Like taking care of the tunnels, killing Yahya Sinwar, maybe going into Rafa.  But again, you need to see this on both sides.  Israel's founding fathers always understood, you know, Ben Gurion said, Umm Shmoom, U.N.  is nothing, right?  But he never thought that.  He never acted like that.  That was for domestic consumption.  Israeli politicians have dragged the cool aid and they now really believe that they can  go on with some sort of disconnect with what's happening abroad. And I think that the Jewish  community everywhere sees this. And I'll give you one example that's going to shock you.  Okay. I spoke with local politicians somewhere in Europe and he told me and I hope, you  know, it was just something he said, but I'm going to quote it. He said, if it goes like  this, and this is not a person who's against Israel, you see demands. So in every town  big city in Europe, you know, there's a Holocaust memorial, right? They're going to have  Holocaust memorials for the Palestinians in Gaza. It's just a matter of politics. You have  the constituency there, right? You know, and we spoke about this trap on your show about  how the Palestinians are seeing this and we are advancing quickly to unilateral recognition  of Palestinian state. I know. So if someone who's a right winger like Gidun-Sao who voted  against the disengagement in Gaza in 2005, unlike Prime Minister Netanyahu at the time,  nobody can doubt his allegiance to Elitesh Leib, or Bennett who also is more to the right  the Netanyahu are saying we're bleeding right now.  In China, actually speaking, internally speaking, maybe it should be considered.  Now, after saying that, I need to be, I try to be honest about these issues.  I can see the argument saying, if we stop now, you know,  considering the damage and the criticism against Israel,  you'll never be able to renew it even if Hamas rebuilds.  Because there is going to be such coverage of what Israel did in Gaza.  But that's the kind of argument or the slippery slope argument of someone who goes into the casino and loses a thousand bucks and then say, I've already lost the thousand bucks.  And I lost my home. So maybe I should take a mortgage and lose the rest.  You need to be rational about this. I'll give you one example.  The government kept on saying, we're not going to sign a full pledge deal to end the war with getting all the hostages back up.  We're not going to do that because Hamas is not going to agree to our terms.  And this is the reason we have a phase deal, a wheat cough kind of deal.  It's going to be like two sections of a deal, two phases.  Right. Now the government is saying we're not willing to consider a phase deal and more.  So what do you account for that change, by the way?  That the government is now saying they'll only go to final deal?  First of all, I don't know if I should believe it.  Secondly, the deal that was signed that Israel decided, you know, when it decided to resume the war and it decided to resume the war,  The deal that it signed was a deal to end the war to begin with. It was never only an  intern deal, right? It had two phases. So I don't understand the statement to begin with.  It sounds like, and this is what Netanyahu critics would say, this is just an  excuse to extend the war. Now he said, I want to have only a phase deal. Now he's saying,  I want to have a full deal.  But Nadav, I think you and I both agree based on our respective sources that  that the Netanyahu government or not any of himself wants to deal.  He wanted to deal.  He was ready to do a deal in July.  Something's happened here where he's...  I think he wants to deal.  I think I've said that on the show.  And this is, by the way,  this is in opposition to many of my friends  who are demonstrating right now  as we are speaking in the street.  First of all, I don't think Netanyahu wants the war  to last in eternity.  I don't think it serves them.  I think what serves him is to win the war to the extent that he can sell to the Israeli  public that the threat isn't there anymore.  And the threat is going to be there.  But as a politician, I think getting the hostages back is as interest.  I think after the Iran war was a prime political interest to get a hostage deal.  What really happened is that Israel paid a very heavy price for an incredibly stupid and  to some extent cruel mistake.  It made back in March.  And Hamas was using it.  Now the question is will military pressure now lead to a deal or will it lead to more criticism  of Israel that could actually lead to lose the war? Will it kill the hostages and lead  Israel to lose the war not only internationally but actually or will it push Hamas again to the  negotiating table? And I have and this is the good news I'm going to end with the last 48 hours  we're seeing assessments in Israel by intelligence sources and by others that there is movement  as to a deal. And that Hamas is now softening its demands coming back to the table.  I don't know if it's softening its demand or Israel that by the way,  Israel took back its delegation from Qatar at the time. But I don't know who's softening right now,  but it seems that the mediator is in all the rest. And maybe this also has something to do  with the administration. And here's an important message. If we want to have a deal, we need to have  a constant pressure of the administration to get that deep of which administration of the  American administration. That's essential. If we didn't have Steve with cough coming to Jerusalem  and to Qatar, but pressuring at the time of the time of the year, we wouldn't have the previous  thing. I think everybody can agree on that. If we didn't have with, of pressuring Hamas, we wouldn't  have that Dean, if we didn't have Bill Burns who doesn't get enough credit, actually  manufactured that Dean that was, you know, pushed beyond the, the online by the Trump administration,  we wouldn't have a Dean. And Brett McGurk, Brett McGurk deserves some credit. And Brett McGurk,  and we need, we need that to happen. And that's, that's crucial now for Israel and for Israel's  allies, you know, to be assisted by the United States. But in the death, we often talk as though  Hamas doesn't have agency. I mean, look at this conversation. We had like 95% of this conversation,  which is though Hamas doesn't get a vote, our conversation right now. So what is Hamas doing?  Anticipating this military operation into Gaza city and preparing for it. First of all, Hamas,  according to the assessments in the idea, has been preparing to the idea of invading Gaza city.  And why we are speaking, there is a chief of staff meeting and in the room, material is  has been presented as to how Hamas has been preparing itself.  Secondly, there is within Hamas a discussion,  an argument between Hamas in Gaza,  led now by a man called Hadad,  who's the regiment commander,  or the battalion commander of Gaza city,  that was one of the people who were preparing October 7th.  The last one, the high echelon of Hamas  that is still alive in the preparation of October 7th,  still alive. And he's now preparing the defense of Gaza city. And he was pushing Hamas and  Qatar in other places. People like Halilah Hayah and others, not to agree to a deal, which  is amazing. If you think about this, because it's Hadad who's in Gaza, seeing hunger,  seeing the humanitarian crisis. And he's not the man who's saying, yeah, we need to get an  agreement. He's the man who's saying, don't get an agreement too quickly because we're  standing because Hamas really doesn't care about the local population. It's really a monstrous  genocide organization. This is what it is. It's absolutely the case that Hamas was making different  demands. Hamas was distancing itself from understandings that were already made in the negotiations.  And they did that because they saw that suddenly their international campaign is working.  And that's one of the reasons that we still do not have a deal.  All right, Nadav, we are going to leave it there.  We are going to pick up later this week,  because you and I are doing an episode.  You're made in voyage on inside Call Me Back.

So, ram through your jungle and turn on the radio and make sure you listen to it's right  here on the air.  And we've got a good reminder by the way.  What's that?  One of our other sponsors, Regal King Doh.  Regal King Doh.  Or it was probably late to his job because he was his hand head of Berkeley from  How much his phone got hot playing regal kingdom,  but he was so excited because he saw  the new sponsors of regal kingdom, bullet boys.  Oh, all of CCR.  What?  Conan O'Brien.  Come on.  And his boss.  And they were just like, really,  you're paying my boss to be one of the sponsors  of regal kingdom, one of the greatest iOS games  where dumb little king pushes around jewels.  Yeah. Maybe?  And then he solves a murder, but then you have to hide under a table from him as the king,  as he's looking for you down the hall.  Gonna give that a clown horn.  And you gotta remember that always underneath the commercials now is always the voiceover  of Isabelle Rosalini, who is always telling you, could I, what is that?  Maybe not, it may not match gameplay.  And the images don't look anything like regal, because when you actually play.  We play a clip from the commercial with that Isabella Rosalini on top of it. Go ahead fire  It which is may not match  Gameplay Regal kingdom the only game where you get to be the king right Isabella  You might not get to be king, but what do you get to get Isabella?  It's unknown until you play the game. What about you?  Kiana Reeves. Whoa. I didn't realize this was just gonna be a copy of Angry Birds.  What about you? Jimmy Fallon.  Whoa. Hey, whoa. His fantastic man. Oh, how it hurts. Oh, my other finger.  Regal kingdom. The only game where you get to be king and play any game you want.  Wow, thank you for playing that Jason. I love hearing that, especially I love the part where the phone burns Jimmy  Jim I was a kimble, but that's a whole other spot.  Uh, oh, Kimbles got it.  Kimbles goes on for 40 minutes.  Oh, four years old YouTube video.  It's insane.  It's crazy that they left in Jimmy Fallon almost losing  his other figure, almost losing it.  It's crazy.  It's like about it.

It's not.  You know, Jeff, I'm becoming very big, bad religion fan.  Emerson's brilliant.  That's, you know, maybe I'm becoming a punk.  Maybe you might be a big fan.  You know, you do have a favorite bad religion song  or is it just crazy tacky, tacky, sour cream?  It's been from crazy, taxing.  Oh, it's my favorite bad religion song.  Of course.  Do they do other songs, Jeff?  Oh, they have many, many, many records.  I couldn't name a single one.  Can you name one, Jeff?  Can you name another bad religion song that isn't  the only one I can think of as the one that I just call  Song and Tony Hawk.  Oh, no, I can tell you one.  Hey, are we good?  Are we okay?  I can tell you every single bad religion song.  And I believe you're referring to do what you want  from the album, No Control by Bad Religion,  one of the seminal albums by this band,  a pop punk luminary that bridge the gap between LA punk  and OC pop punk, the Epitaph world, the Fat Records world.  This is Greg Lemon's sour.  I heard the call of a deep musical knowledge  and I needed to bring out.  And now I have to go back into my hole.  Oh, geez.  Well, that was a crazy thrill.  I got a combo of lemon on that.  I got to stop at the mark.  518 game time.  But also, 518 is the official speed over by La Zanya Junction  right now, 518 miles per hour.  I got them. I didn't stand up to that. I don't know what's happening with the Valverde roads department  but they're trying something over there and you should stay away. Hog Street pretty clear and  That's a crazy through. I'm our spark on what a way point nine the  With birds funeral flowers with birds funeral flowers  Well, I mean, I guess we actually got some traffic that time even though that's the most that we've gotten  I'm thinking about making a change. I'm thinking about making a change. You know, I  Will say I'm a little I'm a little worried about our various speeds though now that we have Joe Walsh  Sammy Hagar running the Department of  Department of streets and motors just making them up as they go  It's like I can't drive 55. I got to drive five 18. What the hell are we doing?  I don't know you're not on the TikTok much, but you are on the Instagram reels every now and then check  You can watch those reels where it's like  You know they've got a bump in the middle of the road and it's a computer-generated bus heading for the bump and they're like  20 miles per hour and it goes it shows the shows the bus going over the bump  And it's like it makes it hooray 40 miles per hour  Little little harder 100 miles per hour. Oh my god  It's flying in the air. They take it up to like 500 miles per hour. This thing is shredding itself through the street signs  You know people try to tell us that social media is stupid and that's destroying our brains  But how do we be saying that with that we're just wrong?  That's just that we're learning things there. I mean before that did you know what it would happen to a bus  If it went 500 miles per hour. I had no idea, but now I do  You know you can do with that knowledge  There's nothing literally I can do with that knowledge.  That's why I was asking because I'm realizing as I'm speaking.  I don't know what I would do with this knowledge.  Knowledge is such a tough, tough, tough thing, Jeff.  Because sometimes you feel smart.  Sometimes you feel like a goddamn fool in the rain.  If you know what I mean, oh baby.  Whoa, I'm former damn.  Shetlin creamies, meaning effort to completely undermine my cattle.  I'm announcing here, I'm the number 10 radio station in all of Valverde.  People don't even listen to it anymore.  And I am selling Shetlin creamies.  You get it?  I'm immortal now.  So I want to spend more time on things that Barbara Dan wants to do.  my podcast, Skin of Max and Jeez, where I just talk about soft core pornography.  You want saw on the channel, Cinemax in the 90s, and the best flavors of Jeez around.  Players you can get right here at Shandlin Creamery's.  Colby, Vardee, Monterey Jack.  I want to focus on those things.  And I don't want my cattle to end up owning the Creamery.  It's a real f***ing dude to the cattle.  So we're taking real offers at Shuttling Creamery's.  Oh man, I know this station is fast.  The hog.  Ahhh, they've been salute to the big ass women in our lives.  We salute you, my queens.  It is queen from the Jazz Out 1978, and fat bottom girls.

And then he told me that that was a rewrite.  And they stuck it to, we are the champions.  And then he said, you're right on the right path about big asses.  Interesting.  He's like, I'm gonna write a song called Big John Korman.  Like, Big John Korman.  I don't know where which which is the what how it doesn't flow. I'm like have you thought about  hmm  fat  To look a lock in  Bottomed so we know where you're talking about  And then I said  asses oh  Fatter masses.

Yeah, they were just like here's an epic song  Here's a song about orcs  Here's a song about just being champions  Here's a song about Flash Gordon and then they're also like here's a song about cars and how I want to fuck them  And then here's a song about just big asses and then 1989 rolls around and they're like  Well, and you says if fuck enscares you I was at the studio when they were recording that and they basically took mics around  Well, I was trying to take a shit my god my short studios  They had it had so many bathrooms in that place. I had to go to each one. There were 42 bathrooms and I get to like the 36 bathroom  And I'm like there's no fucking way  Freddie or Roger's gonna find me in this toilet. No God, no. And I sit down and I'm like finally  All I've been eating sauce is sausage and I'm ready to let it go  I start to grunt and I start to release and I hear  And then I clench.  Oh, I clench and I'm not able to do it three more days.  They're in the studio.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  And I'm like, thank God they're doing the miracle.  I can go over to bathroom number 42.  As soon as I open the door,  I'm the invisible.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, that was a real.  That was a real deacon.  Preecable.  That was a new version of his.  Oh my god, you know, I wish they had done more of the universal monsters.  Queen Queen.  What? Oh, I didn't even have them.  All of them.  I'm the wolf man.  Me?  I am the creature from the black dog.  Go.  Fantastic.  I mean, the steel monster.  Make them.  And then when they started doing that, that dark universe, one of the greatest cinematic universes  that totally fell apart. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you back up. Back up. You're correct.  The best cinematic universe was the, that mummy. Oh, my God. Mummy was something like,  look, I love me some Brendan Frigie. Oh, they love me. Good, oh, Frigie. You get to  Scorpio and King in there and he's got that weird computer generated eye. Oh, yeah. You know,  and I'm just gonna-  Special effects that definitely hold up.  I am on board.  It's like, am I watching Miss the movie?  There you go.  There you go.  TikTok.  Hey, Joe, for you.  We're bringing in all the people to the 108.9  the Hock podcast with references.  Come on in for Miss.  Come on in for jokes about  being visible man from the Queen album, the Miracle.  Hey, man, I held off on talking about the invisible  bear being on the soundtrack to Hollow Man's.  I can't think it.  What a different creepier version that movie would have been.  Well, it is the time of the show for me to talk about my favorite movie of all time.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to talk about  Hollow Man.  Hollow Man.  He's Hollow.  He's Hollow.  Now first up, Jason and Jeff are my, is this the one where they have to like put like tape  around him so they don't lose Hollow Man.  I don't remember because I've always...  I've never actually watched this Paul Verhoeven version from 2000.  Are you okay?  So Kevin Bacon's in it.  He's the Hollow Man.  He's the Hollow Man and he's like, oop, I'm invisible.  You know what I should do?  That's what you're saying.  I should touch Elizabeth Shoe's bullet.  There were...  And he's like, I got ya.  Hollow Man was just a pervert.  We're just getting that on Tony's side.  They're homeless version was just like, you know what I think would happen?  It gets a little perverted.  Oh, and Paul Verhoeven is suddenly like,  when my vision for Hollow Man is that he's a full-on pivot?  And Elizabeth, she was like, I don't think I want to do it, Paul.  I don't think I want to do it.  Well, there you go. That's the same.  Favorite movie. Hollow Man.  Fantastic director that sometimes makes missteps.  We all make missteps like sometimes we find ourselves with an empty chalice of wine  Oh, that's the first time I've asked you Jason so fill that shit up if you don't mind I could use a little  What am I gonna get this morning? Is it a merlot?  It's gonna be a cab town  Nope more penal greasio, please stinky penis wine. I alone will drink that chalice  I let my Pinot greasie o' falls to the floor  My feeling Pinot greasie o' curr-mer-kin  Like oh my rat tails in my mouth. I can't think that's the thing every ten spot  We haven't said that every ten spotter. We can't bottle comes with the little rat tail on it  It's like it's like the little worm in the tequila bottle and every time we mention the rat tail in the bottle  We got to play the laughter  Live wine. When you're talking it, co-opchips wine, live wine. Live wine. Live wine.  That's probably what happened on the set of Hollow Man.  Verhoeve got a little too hooked on the live wine. Live wine. Live wine.  And every idea, I got a little little crazier.  And Kevin Bacon's like, gunna get a boobie.  That was the original tagline for Hollow Man.  Hey, big truck is on location.  Let's go ahead and send the signal down to him.  All right, in my eye.  Chuck, you are on the air.  When we go down in the hawk, the Jeff and Jason show buddy in a long time.  What?  I don't got nothing in this goddamn meteorite here.  Jason, I got plenty.  I got nothing but they're talking hollow man. Am I not delay? How delay am I?  Well, too too to them man, they're gonna use that kind of language this morning down here  God Jason big trucks choking and he thinks we're out of 25 years delay come on. Can we get him back?  Okay, all right. There you are. Oh, hey  Hey Jeff, the angry man, Garlock.  How, what do you angry about today, boy?  I gotta say I'm not angry cause I'm talking to you,  big truck, I'm happy to hear your voice.  Now where are you at?  Your remote location right now.  Where are you?  I'm driving around.  I'm over here at John Cougar summer camp.  It's open, it's open house at John Cougar summer camp.  Now you, Jeff, you wanna camp?  That is all wages.  Oh, milling camp.  all the time. Where you stay in a goddamn  pink house, not air-conditioned by the way, that is something I mentioned to Mr.  Melon over there. Mr. Coogie, Coogie Melon's over there a little while ago and  he just laughed man, he's like I ain't paying for that man. I pay for the  the chili dogs you get to suck down for over there at the at the  I can't team.  He's like, I ain't gonna pay for it to be cold out here.  But have you ever thought like, man,  I'm a grown ass adult who really loves the scarecrow album  from John Cougar, Melon Camp.  I wish there was a camp for me  and you live in the Valverde vicinity  or you're traveling to it.  Maybe you're living in Northern.  I'll come on out here, man.  And you get in and you sign up  And then you live here basically for a while and uh,  Wait, so big truck. So this open house just means you can just start.  It's just the anger man, garlic cheese.  Hi, Jim. You getting angry about anything today?  I'm so Jason. Are we on a delay?  Did you get kicked in the head by a mule big truck?  We just had this discussion.  I can't really say much because I got kicked in the head by a mule man.  John Cougar summer camp.  I got that'll uh Johnny Cougs over here  Brod out his meal. He's like, you know  It's a summer is a summer camera and bring that out the meal  That's my impression. You motherfucker. You know I'm on you know I'm right on the money  He brings out this damn meal. It kicks me first thing it does and I I am just in a loop  Luke I  Can't get out, but hey if you find yourself as an adult  that really loves the John Cougar mill and camp album.  Okay, no, Jason, you're thinking that we gotta cut the favor.  Let's go try and cut that.  My God, and you know what, maybe send the one away point nine,  the Hawk medical team over it.  No, no, no, no.  We need them for here,  cause anything could happen.  Oh my God, actually, I said that and I can see 40 people  have heat stroke right outside.  And then 40 more people are getting hit in the head with beams.  So the house that keep falling, they're falling,  they're falling, they are falling.  Hey Jeff, do you like the group right said Fred?  I just got into them recently.  Oh my God, what are the best?  One of the best bands, well guess what?  We got them coming up next on one away point nine,  the Hock, we gotta take a break,  pay some bills and here's a song about Jagan.  It's 38 special on 108.9.  The Hawk.  Seriously, what do you think they were talking about holding?  Fabulous.  Heroes, grinders, subs, hogies, whatever you call a sandwich, if you're eating it's  little sandwiches, say, I'll take a little.  Hi, I'm Hank Slittle, owner of Slittle sandwiches, Valverde's newest sandwich shop.  You know when I wanted to start selling sandwiches in Valverde, I realized that we didn't  have a regional name for them.  Everyone just called them sandwiches.  So I decided and honor of my father who passed away two years ago.  To call it the Sliddle.  And I'm not gonna lie, until I was selling it in Sandwich form I never realized how gross  my last name was.  Even though it's spelled with an SCH, people think my sandwiches sound like human excrement.  I was just trying to help myself, Valverde.  Yes, I probably should have remembered how much school yard bullies would give me grief for  my last name.  But honestly, I was in grief for the loss of my father, and I put all my energy and money  into this shop, in between signage, starting the LLC, not to mention all that guerrilla  marketing to get recognition for the name Sliddle, and then as soon as it was done, I was  like, oh, oh, and now I sell a regional sandwich name.  Quite frankly sounds like poop. And I can't turn back now!  But they don't taste like poop, I can guarantee you that. So come on in! We have the freshest meats,  the freshest bread, the tastiest vegetables. Not to mention or secret sauce if you want to make your  slittle wet. Nuh-nuh! Just saying that out loud. Now I hear it and... no, I'm sorry dad. So just come on  I'll make your great sandwich. Trust me, it'll taste great and it won't taste like a  s***. I got it man. SLEETLE. No, no, I'm doing it.  This is Ricochet on Daddy from the band Huge Lori. You're listening to 108.9 The Hot.  Oh and I attribute to one of my best friends in the entire world, Mick Ralph's.  guitar, songwriter of that.  passed away recently, very, very sad.  No jokes about it.  No jokes, any of you.

All these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  all these, all these, all these, all these, all these, all these,  you. Oh, they want to do. Hey, I teased it before the, uh, the, uh, the break there when  we had to pay some bills and pay some commercials. We didn't, they, they didn't pay  them. They paid us. I can't. I hope we're not paid. I get kicked in the mule. Did you, did  you get kicked in the mule? Oh, my goodness. I have no idea. Sometimes I got kicked in the  I'm you okay?  Okay.  Well, what was it?  6969 at hog wispy.  6969 at horn dog at the back house.  Well, here they.  My God.  What's this?  That's farmer Dan.  That is not.  Right said Fred.

I'm former Dan Jesus Christ former owner of  Shetland creameries  I sold it  Got all the money and  But a lot of rights to a lot of 90s bands  I get to perform now  Wait wait wait hold on forward  We need to look at this.  Give me me magnet.  be the bank of these means they can powder.  I bought them.  So you're telling it so you don't  know longer.  You no longer own Chetling creamies.  No.  How much money did you get for it?  Monsanto gave me $43 billion.  Oh my god, Monsanto makes it a good, good, better.  Great, Jenner.  If you try their best.  It's just a twitch Colby.  Not your twitch art.  That's not what it does.  I got hold on now. I'm now realize it's this affects your podcast  What are my dad no, I'm still you can still do copies get a max even with  All of the rights to shutland creamers going to Monsanto what just because I don't  Don't own cheese place. I can't talk about how much I love eating cheese  while watching  Relatively horny movies on  I mean Monsanto does have that on a test network.  They don't own my brains and they own skin a max.  They don't own my feelings, but they do own most of the Shannon tweed catalog.  They don't own my ability to fucking lay it down like this.  2 sexy for my farm 2 sexy for my farm my farm it hurts  I'm 2 sexy for a party 2 sexy for a party New York in Japan  Okay, I am not really anything like the original  That doesn't matter to sexy for your keys to sexy for your keys the way of disco dancing  A model you know what I mean  Do a little turn on the kiddo  I don't look over them there  Kill up  Turn  Kill up  Okay, go ahead. I'm listening to this song all weekend long  I'm like, I think this is my anthem. I think it's the greatest song ever heard.  And I can't see that.  The roster coming up couldn't believe we were getting right said for him.  This is right.  I can't wait to see those potentially two skinheads come up here on our slanted.  Definitely in their later days getting politics matching with skinheads.  I'm not done. I'm not done.  Put up.  Put up.  I'm a farmer.  You know what I mean?  And I used to make cheese for you.  in my farm  in my farm  yeah  I  made  cheeses for you  but then i will push  out of my  business by the cattle that wanted me  done  then the made to deal with my son  tell and got me out of the place and i'm  two six e four  month  two six e four  month  two six e four  month  oh okay  he's  oh my god  so now you're just  don't ring them  that you're lying  over here  through the 90s  This is bands that you own.  I don't need, I want to know what other bands he purchased.  This is exactly what I want to hold.  He is out cold.  He didn't even get to the poor pussycat part.  He did it.  He did it.  Can you bring it up for me at least?  Poor pussy.  Poor pussycat.  See, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having that.  So far my dad.  So, okay, so just sit just to recap.  He can't beat me back up.  Monsanto now owns your farm.  The Creamery is owned by them.  You sound possibly like you're not psyched about this deal that you made, but you then used all the money to buy various 90s bands.  It's still unclear if also Monsanto owns Cinemax and even the concept of podcasting they have a podcast deal with the seamless network.  It's a real gra...  Yeah, when I say seamless I mean smartless of course and seamless because I live together  See bliss and smartless you would eat with Jason Bates even tonight  What's not something that makes you bad because he's bad for but  What a bird and seen in the documentary?  It's like sounds like this is gonna be a million eighty million listens, but so you own right-side Fred  What other bands did you buy in this?  This unclear idea of why you decide, and maybe you'll explain to us why you decide to go  for obscure knowledge.  I know that maybe since everyone knew me for what I did before, then maybe you could  know me for something now that's hip.  as hippies of artie cheeses.  And I thought, what's more hip than bands from 30 years ago?  I'm culture is cyclical and I think they're probably his sum.  I'm not sure what the rice said Fred was the way to go first off, but...  But the rice still were 500 groups.  500.  They're all me now. I'm their lawn mower man.  They're all contained in me.  Hit it!  me I'm born and give me a sound show me where to look and tell me is that Jesus  is that Jesus there give me some nug and give me a plate maybe don't throw me out of  my fellow oh god his car my god see I died knew this to you but also remind me  Is this collective soul that you bought?  The black flag is soul and ball is all.  You did a black flag.  It's all okay.  Yeah.  I bought them all.  So I'm just going to say, and maybe through the tears  you can answer.  Do you own Days of the New?  Own them.  Do you own?  President of the United States of America.  What's fucking beaches with that question?  Because I got them.  Because I paid $43 billion for them.  Oh, my God.  Those were them alone.  No, it was a package deal.  Oh, who came in that package, deal?  Tramp lies.  Oh, the eels.  Eels.  New radical.  No.  Filter.  The supposeball heroes of hypocrisy.  Five punch, fart, bag, or whatever they're called.  I didn't have bothered them.  I think I know their five-figure death punch.  And I love them.  Gangstand, of course.  That makes me say.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. My God. So what is your plan with these 500 beds from the 90s and kind  of sub into the two? No, it's if we're going with five finger deathpot. Yeah. I really love  to hear this story too, but I'm going to be over here taking a shit. Hold on. Finally, he's  taking the shit. Yep. Going to go into bathroom number 14 at the one away point nine, the  beach house and I sit down on the toilet Mike still on and  I didn't know too much too much money Mike you just got peekaboo  I hold thing Jeff is that  shetland cream reason was my heart and soul yeah and then when my cattle made a  packed  Monsanto  Well, they had me hogtied  Oh, no bar number four  That's what there was no there were no  There were no way out man  They just pushed the big old  sack coins gold coins equaling  $43 billion really  They paid you in gold coins.  Little man, little little sweaty sweaty man named Doc McGee comes out.  Oh boy, he's late.  I got a deal for you.  I'm like, only shit.  You're Doug McGee.  Of course Doc McGee world famous manager.  Motley crew, I believe.  Kiss.  And the bad super group from the MTV show super group.  That's how I know him.  I'm like, holy shit, man, I'm in a-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  The manager of-  to you.  And second follow-up question did you get one last piece of Colby Jack before you got  one last piece they shut it in my mouth.  But here's the hitch, Jeff.  Give me the hitch.  And I'm not talking the movie, sorry, Will Smith.  I have to keep on performing or a little bomb inside my head goes off.  Oh my goodness.  So I can't stop performing.  So somehow in this Monsanto and Doc McGee have set you up in a crank style Jason Statham  movie.  It's like cranked three.  Don't forget it.  It's like this is gonna be exactly like cranked three and I'm like whatever God from  the show super group.  Do it.  Go tell it to Jason Bottom.  He put his head right up my butt.  Oh my God.  I'm puppin' in the little bum right into my head and now I have to do this.  And they're the worst versions!  Everybody dance now!  This doesn't sound like you're rich in a woe!  Everybody cheese now, and they said you could put as much cheese stuff  in fact, into the songs.  That's the matter, make the little bomb in my head.  Happy!  Give me the music!  I gotta do this!  Everybody dance now!  Oh my god, and you forgot to say cheese!  got to say cheese, is there Bob going on?  I got to get cheese in.  Yeah, cheese.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Say cheese.  Cheese, everybody, cheese now.  And then you do in these songs, Jeff, and you're like,  where do they even start singing?  Here is the dome, back with the bass.  The jam is live in effect, and there are two waves, cheese.  On the mic was the dope rhyme, jumped in the rhythm, jump,  to the rhythm jump and I'm here to combine me to lyrics to make you shake your pants.  Take your hands. Come on, dance. I can't. I can't do it.  I'm so worried. I'm gonna just say it.  I'm just gonna say it, barber, dad. I think this was a bad deal.  If there's one thing I've learned from the crank movies is that nobody gets out alive except for Jason Statham.  And no offense to you. You are no Jason Statham. I'm not gonna do it  reviews  Oh my goodness  Did we shit my god did we just see?  Farmer Dan basically have an aneurysm from a little bomb that was placed in his brain by Doc McGee and Monsanto  He's not saying cheese. I was walking over here from the bathroom by the way John Deacon from Queen is in there  And I still he's been in there all summer. I've all clogged up  I am all clogged up in here. So what happened is far more dead Dan  Farmer, Dan is tonight  I think it came by a meal definitely  forward.  Or did John D.  He'll take you in the head.  I have no while you were in the stall.  Yes.  So you were gone while you were stuck with John D.  Can doing a, a redo of Mark Harmon summer school.  Stuck in the bathroom.  There he goes.  The kids go to take.  No, tick tick tick.  Summer school.  And yes, farmer to get to to summarize.  Farmer Dan is dead because he didn't say cheese enough in all the 90s bands.  over 500 that he bought because Monsanto and Doc McGee were laundering money in a box drug deal  and put a bomb into his brain by shoving.  Doc McGee's hand up his ass.  Just, you know, classic story.  Classic story.  Just another simple, simple, simple Jeff and Wiz show right here from your Monday.  I'll wait for you.  I'll wait for you.  Please, you would absolutely know what you're wondering about the hell gate.  I'm not wondering if Monsanto and Doc McGee could continue controlling.  I'm not gonna mention the fact that we already know  Farmer Dan is immortal. So this is not gonna face him. He's gonna be back it up  I gotta feel it because you get unless he got high lander'd in his head is completely blown off. Oh my god  I hope that's not it. Hey, no matter what we do know that big truck  It was kicked it by mule. So we also again once we get to all those influencers  We probably again should send the medical team over that's they are busy as hell that's true  We got some TikTok's finest influencers coming on in the nine o'clock hour.

If you want to know more about what I'm talking about, check it out, middle of the show.  Welcome to the You Are Not So Smart podcast.  Episode 320.  The classic example is someone who is very convinced they are unbiased, but that thought  process of really stridently thinking you're unbiased.  Ironically, it makes you more biased because you're not open to the idea that you could be  wrong, so you're just following this very narrow track in your mind that allows you to believe  various falsehoods even though you think you're not.  That was the voice of Matthew Fachiani, who is a doctor of sociology, a sociologist, and  interdisciplinary social scientists, which means he researches neuroscience, psychology,  and sociology, and then pushes them all together to help make sense of the world. His focus these  days, his specialty, is media literacy, which means he studies misinformation and polarization,  and how nefarious actors manipulate all of us on purpose to get us to think, feel, and do things  things they would like us to think, feel, and do. He studies all of that and then comes  up with ways to better combat all of that and teaches it to people in the form of media  literacy. He has a podcast called Ms. Guided and he just released a new book titled Ms. Guided,  which is all about misinformation, where it starts, how it spreads and what to do about it.  That title is important here.  Miss Guided.  Because as Fachiaity explains, the research is clear.  The evidence is overwhelming that people who fall for fake news, people who share misinformation,  who believe it, people who just believe things that do other people seem clearly false.  These people are not stupid.  They're not crazy.  For the most part, they have been miss-guided.  And as Fuchiani's research reveals and his book explains, there are a lot of nefarious  actors out there.  Organizations and individuals, political institutions, corporate entities, and so on, that count  on this.  They understand how people actually work, and they use that understanding to purposefully  generate miss information.  These nefarious actors, they produce such misinformation a lot.  That way, you get exposed to it repeatedly.  All in an attempt to mis-guide you toward the assumptions, conclusions, and behaviors they  would like you to assume, conclude, and engage in.  We will talk about all of that in just a moment.  We'll get into things like superordinate identities and affect control theory.  What we can do about all of this is the train headed for the cliff or can we actually create  environment where there's a whole lot less misinformation or just inoculate ourselves  against it?  All of these things are coming up soon.  But first, I wanted to take a second to define just what is misinformation, scientifically  speaking.  According to the American Psychological Association, misinformation is quite simply.  false or inaccurate information.  While this information is false information which is deliberately intended to mislead.  As Fauciani explains in his book, Ms. Guided, misinformation includes both intentionally  and unintentionally false information.  It's put out their own purpose or it just so happens to be not true.  So if you have a belief based on such inaccurate information, that would be considered a misperception.  And as he puts it, if someone were to say, believe that walking backward cures the common  cold, that would be a misperception.  That's a belief that is not supported by the evidence.  That's someone who, for some reason, is misinformed.  Which is not the same as being uninformed.  An uninformed person wouldn't have any beliefs about how to cure the common cold at all.  They're just absent of beliefs in this regard.  In this framework, misinformation is therefore a big umbrella term under which there are  many kinds of misinformation.  So for instance, disinformation in this framework would be intentionally false or misleading  information.  That means the person or people who spread disinformation want the people who are exposed  to the misinformation they spread to believe it.  And they want them to believe it because they have some goal in mind toward which the belief  in things the spreaders know are false serves some purpose.  Propaganda in this framework is a form of disinformation.  Probably, propaganda is used to change attitudes via changing beliefs via misinformation.  So if you want to shift public opinion from negative to positive or positive to negative,  you can do so by identifying an area in which people may be uninformed.  Then you can mis-inform them and then once they are misinformed, they will on their own  generate positive or negative emotional reactions to the issue for which their false beliefs  now provide them with an inaccurate model about some concept or event or institution or person  or political party or so on. For instance, someone who does not live in a major metropolitan  area who has never visited one, they might be uninformed about the rate of crime in major cities.  The truth might be that crime rates have been going down for a long time and are currently  at a 50 year low, but they don't know that.  So an nefarious actor might spread disinformation about high crime rates in major cities for  the sake of misinforming the uninformed.  And now the misinformed will generate negative attitudes about the safety and overall  health of cities they've never visited in person.  You can then manipulate people's deeper beliefs, attitudes and behaviors by suggesting actions,  laws, and blame that those attitudes will now support.  And that's not just some hypothetical, this is how it work.  This has been done a lot.  There is a long history of propaganda throughout all of civilization, especially during  sort of the radio into television era where it became much easier to spread that sort of  thing and get a lot more bang for your book.  Propaganda.  It's a thing that happens.  Still happens right now.  It's happening today.  It's happening wherever there is a device where you can look at things that tell you  how things might be working around you.  It's a real thing.  There's a wide array of this sort of stuff.  There's another kind of misinformation that's rarely mentioned in the literature they call  it mid-information.  And that's when no one really knows exactly what the truth is yet, either concerning a science  fact or historical incident or some sort of evolving situation.  As Fauciani points out, this was the case during the Middle Ages before the development  of germ theory.  Back then most medical experts believed my asthma or bad air was the true cause of the  bubonic plague.  What they didn't know was that it was actually being spread through direct contact with  individuals.  So in this case, it wasn't what they didn't know that got them in trouble so much as  what they thought they knew for sure because they took actions to avoid bad air all the  time, but they did not take measures to avoid direct contact.  So this has been with us forever.  Misinformation in some form or another is part of the human experience.  It's been part of our information exchange for a long, long time.  It's just now the information economy is much more complex and misinformation, disinformation,  propaganda, and so on.  It's much easier to spread and share at scale.  And if that bothers you, you are not alone.  A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of people pulled across 19 countries said  the spread of false information online is a quote major threat.  When polling people just inside the United States, 84% of people said they believed this  This information was a, quote, very big problem today.  But here's the thing, the fallout and impact of misinformation, it's not inevitable.  We actually understand scientifically how all this works and we understand it quite well.  We've been researching this for a long while and we know how to fight against it.  And that's what we're going to talk about in this episode.  As we're going to discuss with sociologist Matthew Fachiani right after this commercial break.  The School of Thought.  I love this place.  I've been a fan of the School of Thought for years.  It's a non-profit organization.  They provide free, creative commons, critical thinking resources to more than 30 million  people worldwide and their mission is to help popularize critical thinking, reason, media  literacy, scientific literacy and a desire to understand things deeply via intellectual  humility. So you can see why I would totally be into something like this. The  founders of the school of thought have just launched something new called  Kitted Thinking Tools, KIT, TD, thinking tools. And the way this works is you  go to the website. You pick out the kit that you want. And there's tons of them.  And the school of thought walls send you a kit of very nice beautifully  designed, well curated, high quality. Each one about double the size of a  playing card matte, cello, 400 DSM stock prompt cards,  and a nice, magnetically latching box  that you can use to facilitate workshops.  Level up brainstorming and creative thinking sessions,  optimize user and customer experience and design,  elevate strategic planning and decision making,  mitigate risks and liabilities, and much, much more.  And each kit can, if you want to use it this way,  interact with this crazy cool app.  Each card has a corresponding digital version with examples and templates and videos and step-by-step  instructions and more.  You even get PowerPoint and keynote templates.  There's so many ways you could use this.  Here's some ideas.  If you're a venture capital investor, you could get the investor's critical thinking kit  and use it to stress test and evaluate different startups for Series A funding.  If you're a user-experienced designer, you can get the user design kit to put together  a workshop with internal stakeholders for a software product.  Or if you're an HR professional, you could mix and match these kits to create a complete  professional development learning program tailored specifically for your team over the  course of the next two years.  So if you're the kind of person who is fascinated with critical thinking and motivated  reasoning and intellectual humility and biases, fallacies and heuristics, you know, those  sort of person who listens to podcasts like you are not so smart, you're probably the  kind of person who would love these decks.  If you're curious, you can get a special 50% off offer.  That's right.  Half off offer right here, you can get half off of one of these kits by heading to kitted.shopkit.edu.shop  and using the code smart50 at checkout.  That's smart50 at checkout.  5% of the profits will go back to the school of thought.  So you're supporting a good cause that distributes free critical thinking tools all over  the world on top of receiving a set of thinking superpowers in a box.  Check all of this out at kitted dot shop or just click the link in the show notes.  And now we will turn to our program.  My name is David McRaney.  This is the You Are Not So Smart Podcast.  our guest in this episode is sociologist Matthew Fauciani. And who is that? Matthew will tell  you.  So I am a social scientist who studies why people believe the things that they do. I've  been working at the University of Notre Dame for the last few years and their computer science  department where we've been studying how to teach media and digital literacy in a way that's  scalable and engaging.  wrote a book about all this and I think the title is important. Miss Guided is a good term that I will  use and I will cite you and I use it because what I often see in discourse about all this is to assume  that if people are behaving in ways that you disagree with or they believe things you disagree with  that they're stupid or that they are rues,  or that they have been tricked  because they're stupid in rues.  And the framing of they've been misguided  is the different frame when you get them  into the scalpel first, like this.  So let me ask that as a question.  Are people who fall through misinformation  Matt, the expert on this topic?  Are people who fall for misinformation stupid?  No, to give a yes, no answer.  I would say no.  Because there's so many intelligent people  that fall for misinformation,  it kind of goes against that idea.  And my whole point is that we're all vulnerable  to this process because we're social creatures  remotivated by these social motivations  to belong in our groups and to have community.  And I start out the book and often use this example  outside my book, but the idea of like flat earthers  and how there was this really great documentary  behind the curve that came out a few years ago.  They're really dives into this very beautifully.  They talk about the community and the social aspects  of people who believe the earth is flat.  And how those use conferences and friendships  that develop and this community around that.  And I think that's so critical  understand the community component  because it provides with so much self esteem  and makes us feel supported within ourselves.  So I think when we think about like  why someone might believe something false,  even something as extreme as the earth being flat,  that belief by itself may not have a big impact  or any impact on their day-to-day life.  So whether the earth is hexagon or square or spherical,  it's really not changing the day-to-day life,  But what definitely impacts the day to day life  is if they lose all their friends  and people they care about in their community.  So from that perspective, it's actually pretty rational  to uphold this belief and say,  I'm gonna continue believing what my friends  and close connections believe  because I wanna maintain that community.  And these people care about me, I care about them.  And this belief is part of a larger set of beliefs  that kind of holds us together  and we can connect with each other.  So, to me, it is very rational from a psychological perspective to maintain a variety of beliefs,  some of which may be false. And that speaks to my larger point about the book, misguided.  Ms. Guided is something that happens to all of us. It's a process of being guided by social forces  that provide us with self-esteem and meaning and reductions of uncertainty.  So we have this strong motivation to protect our identities and our groups that provide us with this meaning and self-esteem.  So a lot of times, like we're very positive, we're guided towards being a good parent because we care about our children.  Like that's an identity process.  Or, you know, we want to do well on our sports team because we care about the sports team that we belong to.  But when we belong to a political team, for example, sometimes that support of that political  identity and that support of the political team might mean rejecting certain facts that  make the political team look bad.  And that's where we run into these issues with people having this motivation to protect  that identity so strongly that they will reject information and believe falsehoods sometimes.  So that's kind of like the larger issue of identities.  And then it gets more complicated as you dive into the context  to which these identity forces are most impactful.  If we're going to know the second,  but I just love how surprising this can seem  to be uninitiated because you're doing it all day every day.  And we've been doing it all day every day  for the entirety of human civilization.  Right.  Yeah.  And yet this can still seem quite surprising.  Yeah, I felt similar, I mean, you know,  I study this stuff every day.  So like, I know other people who don't,  maybe don't think about it as much  and it could be a lot more novel.  But I think it's even broader and deeper than that  because whenever you're learning about these social biases  that, okay, we have this motivation  to protect important identities.  And we have this motivation to protect identities  and meanings that bond us with our communities.  What the broader message is that we're actually  motivated by these forces that we're not always  aware of or thinking about.  And human beings like to believe that we're  very rational and logical and we're making decisions  completely by logic and reason.  And we're just in control driving how we believe things  and how we come to different conclusions.  But the reality is much more complex  and that we have a lot less control than we might think.  And we might be very biased by our environments  and the social and psychological forces behind that.  So I think some of that requires awareness  and this broader intellectual humility that yes,  we can be biased and yes, there are forces  that we might not even know about.  and appreciating that makes us less biased.  So it's kind of interesting whenever someone is trying to say,  like, no, I know.  The classic example is someone who is very convinced  they are unbiased.  But that thought process of really  stridently thinking you're unbiased, ironically,  makes you more biased because you're not open to the idea  that you could be wrong.  So you're just following this very narrow track in your mind  that allows you to believe various falsehoods,  even though you think you're not.  What comes up a lot in these discussions,  I find is the information deficit models,  what comes up because it just seems like,  if you just saw the things I saw,  if you just been exposed,  especially in academia,  if you just exposed the information that I've been exposed to  and just acknowledge that I am an expert on this topic.  And so therefore, take a look at this information  that I have provided for you.  Then you'll look at that and go,  oh, okay, I was wrong about that.  And it seems to me there's an element of,  this group is trusting one source of information,  this group is trusting a different source of information.  As a question, what would you suppose  is the difference between a person who believes  here at this round, a person who believes there's flat,  when it comes to who they're trusting?  But yeah, I mean, what's altering that  different trust basis?  Trust is such a critical component.  And it's also another very social type of thing here,  because it's comprised of how you feel about the person  and how competent you are, you think they are.  So it's interesting to think about trust  in the form of experts, because so much of how we determine  if someone's trustworthy or not,  is not just a very technical aspect of how competent they  are at certain problem solving.  It's not like we're just viewing all their test scores  something and saying, okay, this person's competent or not. A huge chunk of trust is warmth.  Is how do you believe that this person has your best interests in mind? And that component  is a huge predictor of whether or not we trust someone. So if you don't know any scientist  personally or any physicians personally, then you might have less interaction with them.  And it might be more easy to believe that they're not having your best interests in  mind and they might be corrupted somehow.  So as far as the flatter thing, it's like, okay, imagine you have this contrarian free  thinker influencer that you like to follow who is always in your phone and your hand every  talking to you directly, sometimes responding to your comments.  And you have this connection with them.  It might be a pair of social connection, but it's still a social connection with this person.  And you believe that they have your best interests in mind.  They're constantly affirming identities and questions that you have.  So you trust them.  And they might think that they're earth is flat,  or they're presenting that view to you.  And maybe they're showing some of their work in a technical looking way.  And you trust that because of the social connection you have with them.  And you can compare that to this faceless abstract scientific institution that releases a statement  on their website and says, you know, the earth is round.  Well like from a psychological perspective, which one of those pieces of information are  more likely to trust?  The person that you have this ongoing social contract with or this faceless abstract  non-human entity of just this big science group that you're supposed to distrust.  I think that really speaks to how we form trust and then what that looks like in practice  and how a lot of these institutions have been super slow to adapt to the current media landscape  and have been so cautious to have dialogue with people that now we're seeing the negative  effects of that, where we need people like going on podcasts and having dialogue with people on  social media from these institutions, whether it's academic institutions or medical institutions,  science institutions, because people want to see that level of social reality, that social  relationship. And if you don't have that, then you're already being reduced so much in the components  that determine if you're trustworthy.  And it creates a vacuum for someone else to come and be like, hey, that person's not  even talking to you.  Or when they do talk to you, it's a very patronizing, like, top-down type of process.  So instead, trust me.  And I will talk to you and I'll give you access and, you know, answer all your questions  directly.  So you were seeing that asymmetry between these institutions that didn't value science  outreach enough and all of these influencers who are all about outreach and connecting with  their communities, how the asymmetry and trust conform from that perspective.  You talk about this in the book.  There's a question of how much of this has always been the case and how much of this is new,  especially when it comes to the polarization.  And you go from the Zomaniac and the street,  you're like crazy things in your small village.  And you know that person and everybody knows who that is.  And then you switch us to every maniac that has access to the internet's yelling and  and alters like the signal to noise ratio and what goes the top. And then you've got  newspapers that radio at the television, the internet. Every single one of those changes the  information economy and the attention economy and the and then what gets incentivized. And what  everybody's consciously or unconsciously A, B testing all of that and going with what works,  especially if you make a living off of it.  Cable news started having, you know,  punditry that was just angry is that,  it's like, in my perspective,  it's like accuracy was never what was connected  to the person who was that they were angry  at the same things you were angry about.  Exactly.  And that's the issue that's at stake.  That's what's actually the motivation.  Even when you're arguing with your family member,  like what you want them to do is come over to your size  to what's no longer in us versus them situation.  And the actual topic is almost irrelevant.  And you just want to want you on my side.  Right.  So that you're motivated by the same things  I'm motivated by and you're angry at the same things.  I'm angry about it.  And the landscape just adapted to it.  So that's what you do upfront is portray your anger  and portray your us versus thinness and everything sorts.  that seems new or at least how quickly the economy can adapt to that is faster  than now. I think I'm on the right track there, right?  Yeah, absolutely. I think the psychological biases that we've been talking about  have been around since humans have been around. But what is different now is the speed and  the scalability of enacting those biases. I mean, social media makes it instant,  whereas before you'd have to have a group of people actually meet them in person and have conversations,  And then it gets really messy.  And I think that's kind of another interesting distinction  of before whenever you would try to bring up politics  or something.  Like, if you were embedded in within your local community  and you were like going to community events  and interacting with lots of different people,  there was, you knew you had to have future encounters  with these people.  So you had to treat them with respect and, you know,  mutual respect and understand that they're full humans  with their complex ideas just like you.  But with the age of the internet and social media,  you can self-select people who think almost exactly  like you and affirm your identities and your ideologies  and make the world much cleaner.  And these are all the good guys on my side  who agree with me 100%.  And everyone else who's disagreeing with me is on the bad side.  And it just makes it so simple and so quick.  and algorithms amplify that and keep showing you stuff  that you like and you're interact with.  And AI makes that even more personalized.  Like we're just like streamlining these psychological biases  to make them more impactful.  So it's not so much that like social media itself  is creating polarization.  It's just making these existing social psychological biases  much easier to be introduced to us  and then amplified and reinforced as we interact with them.  I think this is one of the things that is most difficult  for like a, especially in a United States culture,  but just Western culture and general.  You wanna think that people are being misled  and they're being tricked.  And the battle is like to fight the agents  who are brainwashing people.  And there's a little less emphasis on a person  actively choosing to engage or disengage with certain sources and information.  The idea that there will be any responsibility involved is a prickly thing to introduce to  the conversation for a lot of people. And who do your thoughts are on that?  Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting, yeah, I think both, this is something that both sides of the  political spectrum will say. It's like the other side is there's brainwashed, there are NPCs or whatever.  And I think that's an interesting idea of itself.  Because what does that say about how you view other people?  Do you view other people as just these easy to lead and mislead people?  But you're not part of that.  So it's very much othering this group of people that it's like you're assuming  they have completely different psychological processes than you do.  And this is not true.  human beings, we all have these social psychological biases. Again, that's like my main  point is like we all have these and we're all vulnerable to it. And it's important to understand  what context and what situations make these biases more impactful. So yeah, I think it's  an easy way to just ascribe a simple explanation to something, especially if we don't like  the outcome. That goes into just world hypothesis stuff and thinking about neat, simple solutions  of, well, you know, my dad, I want to believe my dad is good. And what he's believing is something  I consider not good. So there must be this external thing that's driving that. And instead of  like, under diving into the complex interplay of environment and social influence and how we  all of these biases. I'm just really, really things in a way, but I find that to be...  One of the things that most nature corresponds to is this othering that you're describing.  Because there's just so much research into the world. People will actively avoid certain  types of information. You do that enough. When it was just newspapers or books, there's  one sort of impact there. But as you're describing it, constant from the almost...  If you're especially if you wake up and you begin doom scrolling within  you know, 30 seconds of entering conscious reality again like  like yeah, you're doing a lot of work to stay inside your bubble.  Right.  A lot of people are helping you do that more and more and almost making it as easy as  ordering room service. But it's you know, it's a the effort you have to put in to doing  the thing that you're going to do. They're making it so easy to get from here to there.  Okay, I can talk about that forever and I'll turn a lot of time to talk about that because  I find that particularly fascinating right now.  Identity, that's a word that is in the common parlance, but an actual social scientist,  a cognitive researcher has a much more robust understanding of the term identity.  So let's just start there.  From a scientific perspective, what do we talk about when we talk about identity?  Yeah, great question. So from a social science perspective, how I can go other people have different identity or different definitions of identity.  So that's a whole other conversation of like the nuance there. But broadly speaking from a social psychological perspective.  And identity is defined as a set of meanings that allow us to identify with a role or a social group or a unique characteristic that defines a set of unique person.  So the set of meanings is really how we're thinking about it. So what does that mean? And how do we define those meanings and how we measure them?  people we can try to track how they interact with different things, but really  thinking about identities as meanings and values that we want to adhere to. And  why that matters is because once we know that there is these important  identities and then associated with these important values and meanings, we  then know that people have this motivation to protect those identities by  acting in ways that are consistent with those meanings and values. And when people act in ways that  are consistent with these meanings and values, it provides them a source of self-esteem. So there's  this constant motivation to maintain consistencies between the behaviors that we do, the information  that we process, and the meanings and values associated with those important identities. Because  they provide us with this feedback loop of self-esteem.  So for example, let's say you're a student and you care about being a good student.  That's an important identity for you.  There's roles associated with that identity, such as studying and going to class.  And whenever you're studying and going to class and then you're getting good grades, that  provides you a self-esteem boost because you care about that.  And it allows you to verify that identity in your mind in a way that keeps giving you  this positive feedback loop.  So you want to keep studying, getting good grades, being a good student, and so on and so forth.  So that's the positive aspects of identities.  And not only do we have this feedback loop with self-esteem, identities also allow us to  connect with other people who share characteristics with us so we can form bonds and provide  all the social support and communities. So there's all these positives that go along with identities,  like this constant verification of the meanings and the values of these identities make us feel good.  So we're constantly motivated to do that. But as we've been describing, whenever we have this  motivation to protect those identities and act in ways that are consistent with those meanings,  Sometimes it means rejecting facts and rejecting reality in a way that's adhering to these  falsehoods because what matters more is protecting those identities, protecting that source  of self-esteem and protecting the communities associated with those identities we belong to.  And that's where we see issues of vulnerability to misinformation.  We like to think about identity as something that just is.  that was this is why I either was born with this identity  or I chose it from the panoply of options.  The fact that I was influenced  to consider this identity important to me  is something we'll get prickly about  because it feels like I have no agency involved.  Agency is a keyword there.  And I think that's one of the challenges  with having these types of conversations  is we have to acknowledge that we have less agency  might think. And that's an uncomfortable truth to try to present with people. You know, talk about like a meta discussion of identity.  Yeah.  Because identity is, it feels like it's synonymous with agency, but it's not.  Right.  Yeah, it's a psychological process. Like we're measuring psychological bias in the form of social influence through identities.  And when we have these identities, they do happen, sometimes randomly.  Like college is a good example because you're meeting lots of different people and you're kind of growing up and becoming who you are.  And your identities can be formed by just who you interact with, who you have class with.  Like if you're just walking through campus and this kid comes up to you and is like, hey, you want to join my club and let's say it's a religious club.  and he seems really nice.  And then you become religious, ultimately,  because of that interaction,  or maybe you become non-religious  if it's like an atheist club.  So it's like, you might not even think  that that was a thing that pushed you,  but what do you think of like the preponderance  of your social interactions  were motivated again to be the social creatures  and have social support from people we care about.  And that can be due to who we connect with.  And that can be a very random process  that we don't always like to think about.  Which is in itself.  We could have been born into a culture  that was more okay with that.  Yeah, it's good.  That is so quick.  Yeah, it's just my favorite thing.  And we can have many identities  as you talk about in the book.  You can be a parent and a teacher and a musician and ex-military and American and from Iowa  and a fan of this and you like this and I go to this conference and this convention and  I like this TV show and all these things are multiple aspects.  I do think they can become, depending on the context and depending on the other people  that share it will have more impact on your cognition and behavior because it rises  and the importance of that context that identity is front and center.  Tell me a little bit until everybody in the world would look about the difference between  identity salience and identity prominence.  Yeah, so identity prominence is referring to how personally important the identity is to  you.  identity salience is more about if it's top of mind or not.  So if something is salient, you're thinking about it.  If something is prominent, it's more of a deeper personal association with that identity.  And both of those influence our behavior, because if we're reminded about an identity  we have, so it's more salient, we're also more likely to want to support that identity  and act in ways consistent with that identity.  if it's an important identity, a prominent identity,  we're also motivated to support it.  And these are constantly changing what's top of mind  for us is a constant process of like,  if you remind someone about their identity,  then they may be more likely to think about it  and then have a motivation to protect it.  So one of the studies that I mentioned  that kind of dives into this is this political identity  study where if you have people right about their political identities, they become more biased.  And that's because they're thinking about it more.  And they're like, oh yeah, I'm a conservative or I'm a liberal.  And now that I'm thinking about this, I'm going to respond to even having stronger political  attitudes than the group of people in the study that you don't ask to think about your  political identity.  So it's becoming more salient in their mind.  It's more top of mind.  And it was already important to them for many of that.  So both of those concepts explain how motivated we are to protect these identities when  we're consciously thinking about them or unconsciously thinking about them if it's a deeper  broader personal importance, like with prominence.  You did research into this affect control thing.  People heard a story.  I'm sure a little bit if you could about this, the research you did into the affect control  theory.  Yeah, so alpha-control theory talks more about how we feel towards cultural ideas and how  we think about different components of language.  So you mentioned language.  So you might find this interesting because what we're actually doing is evaluating each word  on three dimensions of meaning, like evaluation, potency, and activity.  evaluation, good bad, potency, strong week, and activity, like really active or more passive  and slow. And there's been a lot of research on showing that these three dimensions of  meaning really break down a lot of concepts just with those three factors.  Yeah, so this is like part of my dissertation work. So it's been a few years since I've  really dove into this. But I remember it being such a cool way to try to quantify how  navigate our social and cultural worlds. Because whenever we experience the world in a way that  contrasts from what we expect, it creates this sense of unreality and this kind of like  a-oh response and we're motivated to try to fix that in some way. So for example, I think this is  an example I provided in my book. One way to study this is through really short statements and  One statement is, I think, like mother hurts child.  So you break down each of those components  even more specifically.  Like mother, we think more positively for as a culture.  So this word in this concept, we think, okay,  mother, good, hurt is a bad thing.  So a bad action, a strong action.  And then child, we think good.  So it creates this cultural inconsistency  and this psychological inconsistency for us  to read that sentence of mother hurts child.  We think, uh oh, like something,  we then are motivated to reframe one part of that sentence.  So maybe the mother, we think, is a bad person.  We say, oh, this is actually like more of a monster,  not a mother.  Or hurt, maybe we're saying, oh, maybe hurt  is just they're disciplining them.  They're not actually hurting them.  So we're trying to reframe this constantly in our mind  to try to make sense of the world.  And I think that's an interesting way to think about how we process identities and biases on a very granular, detailed level.  It's like, even at the level of each word, we're trying to make sense of it.  And we are rejecting these inconsistencies whenever we see them even at a very lower level.  So, uh, to connect to the politics, which is like the easy political identity to fit in here.  If we're a Republican, we're a Democrat, and we read a story about like Democrat Hertz person.  If we're a Democrat, we read that. We're like, oh, well, we're less likely to think that's true.  But if we're a Republican, we read that same sentence, we're more likely to think that's true.  Because the Republicans are evaluating the word Democrat very differently than Democrats are.  So you can really like quantify at a very simple mathematical level how, how much conflict  people are going to perceive these statements based on their own identities.  And that's what I was trying to study in my dissertation is really breaking down these political  attitudes at this like, sennatical level of, okay, Democrats and Republicans are going to evaluate  each other differently. And that also means that they're going to evaluate the likelihood of events,  differently based on how they are evaluating different words.  So like Democrats and Republicans, I think in my dissertation, I did use the example  Democrat Hertz person, Republican Hertz person. So Democrats and Republicans evaluated the words  hurt and person pretty similarly, but they evaluated Democrat and Republican very differently.  And you can do this mathematical equation of seeing how much conflict there is between  the words in that particular sequence.  So a Democrat reading the sentence, Democrat hurts person, creates a lot of conflict or what's  called in the literature deflection because you're saying good word is doing bad thing  And that's this big conflict in your mind,  whereas Republicans, it creates a lot less deflection  and less conflict in their mind  because that is more similar to their expectations  based on their identities.  And so we can kind of like mathematically operationalize  how much psychological conflict  are people experiencing when they read these short sentences.  And then you can expand that to like a broader way  of how they view their worlds where, all right.  So right from the beginning, we're seeing that this person is going to consider this  social situation much more or less likely depending on the identities that they have.  And that likelihood is really what a driving ad is like, how likely do you think this event  is?  And that likelihood is dependent on how you evaluate each component of the social situation.  So again, if you're viewing the actor in this situation good or bad, you're going to view  the subsequent behaviors of that actor differently.  So it's kind of speaking to this broader identity bias, but it's really diving into the  details of like, okay, here are the nuts and bolts of where it starts.  And you can see these like building blocks of identity bias based on how people just  evaluate certain words and certain actors they experience in their environments.  Something you wrote up, I think it was an amazing who had brought this up. I have noticed this,  and it's a strange thing, and I'm wondering if you had any insights into this or just any curiosity  about it. It seems to be in my lifetime, and I could be wrong about this, and maybe this  happen to all throughout history. I just happened to be in a pocket of it what's happening now.  Being in American culture, being a Democrat or being a Republican has become this superordinate  identity. And you can say left versus right, but it seems like this this this becomes salient,  this becomes the thing. And then this mega identity as she was describing it. This feels at least  in my lifetime. It feels stronger than ever, but I'm wondering if you have any insights  as to how did that come about? Why is that now our superordinate identity across all sorts of  context? Yeah, I think there's a variety of reasons for this. One thing has just been how you  could talk of like the macro level of how political discussion from political leaders has changed  has become much more adversarial in just the past few decades. So you can see this like top down  effect of people becoming much more aggressive towards their opponents, considering their opponents  as the enemy more versus just someone they disagree with. And we saw that in the 90s with like  new King Ritchen stuff, where the language used was just very different. And so that's  That's like the macro level.  But then there's also the personal level.  And the environment we are in now  is very different than it used to be.  So we talked about social media.  Social media is just amplifying this existing process.  So we already have these social biases,  these social identities, and these networks that amplify  these identities.  But now you can find your own cable channel  that supports your political identity.  Whereas before there wasn't like a personal cable channel  that it was more of a broad channel that applies to everyone.  So now it can be personalized with one identity of the other,  but not just cable identities like it was in the 90s  and early 2000s.  Now we're seeing social media.  You can have your very personalized social media  information that will support your identity  and tell you the other identity is bad.  So it's this amplification process.  And that's really the major vulnerability  that I see with these identity processes.  It's not so much that we have these identities that bias us.  Like, yes, we should be mindful these identity biases,  where it really becomes a problem is the spaces where it's  reinforced to be the superordinate identity,  like you speak of, or this mega identity.  And what context and situations allow for that to happen?  So any sort of amplification process  is going to make us more vulnerable to these identity  processes.  And that could be surrounding ourselves  with people who think just like us and are constantly reinforcing our identities and our beliefs  and our meanings associated with those identities.  So that again, that could be like a cable news show you watch it and it's constantly affirming  that.  But then it's not just cable news, it's your social networks, it's your social media,  and it's constantly amplifying these existing forces to create such a strong polarization  that connects other identities together.  And that can be because when we are navigating our world,  we wanna associate with people who are like us  and share our characteristics.  And when politics is such a driving force of who we are,  we wanna be around people who think similarly to us.  But this can be an issue when we are so motivated  to be around people that we share characteristics with, that we stop assusting with people  who think differently than us or have different backgrounds.  And this relates to this idea and this research topic that I talk in a book of this, this  social psychological concept of social identity complexity.  And that's a really interesting way to think about identities.  So it's not just that we have this identities that exist in vacuums, but our identities operate  in a context of intersecting with other identities.  And how does that influence us?  So if we have, let's say, our political and religious identity, how much overlap do those  two identities have?  If they have complete overlap, this is an extreme example.  Let's say we have four really important identities in our lives, which is just an extreme  example.  Let's say our political identity, our religious identity, our volunteer identity, and  our friend identity.  So this is who we are.  So let's pretend that our religious and political identity completely overlapped.  All the meanings are 100% agreement.  And we volunteer at our place of worship.  So we are there, we care about the volume of volunteer, it's also connected to this.  And all of our friends are also at this place of worship and also share our political  beliefs.  Then in this example, 100% of how we derive our social self-esteem is based on this very narrow  lens of meanings that are all within this four identities that completely overlap and completely  amplify and increase the prominence of these identities.  So it's not just that these are personally important to us, but they share meanings with  other personally important identities that then enhances the overall importance of those meanings.  So 100% of how we view ourselves is through these few meanings associated with these identities.  So any information that challenges those identities challenges 100% of where we derive our self-esteem from.  So it's a super strong personal attack that makes us motivated to reject it because it feels very  very uncomfortable, very very negative. You could think of the converse of that where we have a  much broader set of identities that do not overlap very much. So we can still have a political and  religious identity. Let's say they're not over-connected all that much. Our church doesn't even  really talk about politics all that much. And let's say we volunteer, but we volunteer at like a  a pet shelter, something completely outside our church.  And we have friends that maybe a few go to our church, but we have a lot of friends who don't  go to our church.  So our friend identity is much broader.  Now our meetings associated with our identities are spread across a wide range of social  support systems.  So whenever we encounter information that challenges our political identity, it's only  a small subset of where we're deriving self-esteem from.  And we're much better able to absorb it  and process it more objectively,  because it's not completely attacking our entire sense of self,  but only a small component of it.  And that's how we're more resilient towards misinformation  if we're experiencing information that is false,  that challenges these identities.  Oh, that's awesome.  I'm gonna make a new slide for my next thing.  I'm gonna present to talk about this.  It would take a long time to get here on your own,  but once you see it, it's like,  ah, yeah.  You kind of have to build it up, yeah.  But once you get it, then you can just see it.  Like I literally try to see,  like what I visualize is you can write it down on a map  and some people have talked about  like how that could help reduce polarization  by actually like visualizing your identities  on a piece of paper.  But like you can see how this all connects  because we have our identities  our identity maps and how much overlap they have spatially. And then you can see the network  effects of all those identities amplifying them. And then if you really get really crazy and granular,  you can think about that affect control theory and how we view social situations based on  our evaluations of specific words and actions and how that is all interacting with each other  and potentially amplifying our susceptibility to misinformation and bias. So it's like  like it gets really complicated,  but that in that complexity,  you can really start to understand  the broad effect of how we're vulnerable  to these social biases and what we can do about it.  Yeah.  And I'm imagining all throughout our history  of different types of ways of being civilized,  villages, communities, empires,  how that alters the way your identities get a chance  to be overlapped just because of the practicality  of the situation and the geographical limitations.  And you don't have a media source,  you don't even have literacy yet.  So it goes like you.  It's my politics and my religion and my friends  and my volunteers, it's all smushed up.  And it makes sense that when you meet,  you suddenly, when this group suddenly meets the Romans,  like, oh wow, there's not a whole lot of overlap here.  Exactly.  Yeah, so it's wild to think about how much we can visualize  these processes happening.  And it makes a lot of sense of how strong and quickly  that othering can be when it's not just,  okay, it's one identity.  It's this confluence of all these identities  that amplify each other.  And that's really where that polarization stems from.  This is basket stuff.  Okay, I do want to get one last thing in.  And sure, which is, and this is a question  to take two hours for you to answer.  So I understand that.  In these discussions, no matter who you're talking to,  if you're talking to somebody who seems like the next person,  the question is, okay, what would we do about this?  Because it seems like we're like with the trains headed  for the cliff.  What options are available according to the research we've done  that seems actually has, can have some positive impact  on all of those?  Is this just an inevitable outcome of what happens with society's get complex or do we have options here?  And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.  Yeah, so it is a big question and yeah, we'll take several hours to really dive into it.  But to try to summarize it, what I've been referring to is the particular vulnerability of our  susceptible to misinformation from a social science perspective.  My point is that happens under context where our identity biases are amplified and reinforced.  So in order to reduce that vulnerability, we need to reduce that reinforcement and amplification process.  And that's kind of like a good starting point of like, okay, well, now we actually are defining stuff.  So it's like, okay, so where do these vulnerabilities take place?  One is, you know, social media is an easy one, so you can kind of visualize it.  And I think we have an idea of what that looks like whenever we're in these hyper echo chambers on social media,  it provides a way to amplify and reinforce these identities.  So trying to break out of that is be one way, like trying to not doom scroll and constantly obsess over whatever your particular  particular political ideology is trying to break out of that.  And I think people are aware of this,  like the whole idea of like touchgrass.  Like that's a common thing.  Like people know like, yes, sometimes it's good  to vlog off and meet people in the real world.  And it sounds so simple and obvious, but it's true.  Like literally just getting outside social media,  outside whatever these screens  or how we're receiving these online information,  It's important to take a break and not allow yourself to become radicalized through this  reinforcement process that will take advantage and exploit these identity processes that we've  been describing. So actually like meeting lots of different people, again, it seems so obvious and  simple, but I think it's a really important component to improve our resilience to misinformation.  we need to expand our diversity of identities.  And what that could look like is simply volunteering at different places,  getting a new hobby, meeting different people, joining a sports league.  So again, it seems silly, but there's so much power in literally joining a local sports league  and meeting people from all different backgrounds.  So that's why I really enjoy sports because one, it's like good physical exercise  and good for your mental health, but all those good for your social health.  Like just meeting lots of different people and being active and thinking about how  there's a variety of people out here from different perspectives that you might otherwise not  have a chance to meet. So personally, on an individual level, we can try to expand our identity maps  and do different things, meet different people, and not have our identities so wrapped up in a  narrow set of meetings. So we can individually we can do that. Now the issue is like what does that  look like on a societal level? And we don't always have opportunities to do that. So in the United  States we don't have a lot of what's called third spaces where you know we have our home, we ever work,  but there's not really a lot of good community spaces where we can meet lots of different people.  So that's kind of the tricky part is like how do we fund initiatives for more people to do this?  This requires a whole structural bigger picture thing, but there are opportunities for people  to join sports leagues or volunteer with different things, meet people at their local libraries  and stuff.  There are publicly available things like that.  That's one part.  I think it's diversifying ourselves, diversifying our identities, diversifying our networks.  Then there's the education component, which is what I've been working on for the last  few years.  not only do we have to be aware of our social biases and work on that, but that should  be merged with this idea of becoming as media literate as we can.  Like how do we learn how to navigate our media and information landscape as best we can?  And that speaks to some of the work that I've been doing at Notre Dame, developing these  short media literacy games that teaches people different aspects of verifying the credibility  of sources, for example.  what's called lateral reading often, where instead of looking within an article and trying  to fact check it within the confines of the article, you're going laterally and opening new  tabs and seeing who the author is, what their biases might be, what outlet are they writing  for and what journalistic practices does that particular media out that have.  So like learning those skills is also really important.  And in the age of AI, I think that connects to digital literacy, learning the limitations  of artificial intelligence and these large language models, these chatbots.  So, like, there's that whole education component too.  But the education component, I would argue,  can only go so far.  You have to have that social understanding as well.  And that awareness of your own social biases,  because that allows you to combine the best of both of those techniques.  Where it's like, okay, now I know how to fact check.  And I'm aware of my social biases.  So, I'm not just fact checking stuff  that's inconvenient or convenient for me.  So that's on the individual level,  is trying to understand how we can learn about our biases,  learn how to fact check better,  and how to navigate the internet.  So that's individually,  but then I could also go into the meso and macro as well,  because I think that's also important.  So I dive into this into my book  about the meso level of basically communities,  and what that looks like.  So we've talked about trust  and how trust is a social process  of how we trust someone  when they think they're competent  and we think they have our best interests in mind.  So that might require forming relationships with someone.  So what I would like to see happen  is more of these scientific and medical institutions  that have lost some trust  actually go out in their communities  and form relationships again  with their local communities  or on social media, like actually invest in this  and have people speaking about  what is the importance of a university?  What are they actually doing?  What research are they doing  that makes a difference in your life?  And that reduces this psychological distance  between people who are not familiar with universities  and the universities themselves.  So, you know, I often think like,  I'm within academia, I know a lot of scientists  and physicians.  So for me, it's a lot easier for me to trust them  because I know them personally.  But if you don't personally know these people,  then that creates a barrier and it creates an opportunity  for someone else to be like,  hey, don't trust those people.  You don't even know them.  Trust me instead.  And I think if more opportunities existed  for partnerships between local community leaders  and their hospitals and universities  and really invest in those partnerships at a local level  and then scale that throughout the United States.  Like that's like my big picture.  If I could wave a magic wand,  I would have these hospitals and universities  have resources to invest in those community outreach programs.  And then of course, there's like big, big picture  of like thinking about social media  and what they can do a better job on.  And that gets really tricky  because it requires regulation.  But I mean, some simple things are just like having  these companies share their data more and have more transparency.  That's something, unfortunately, that we've drifted away from,  because ideally, we'd have independent researchers  studying these platforms and having access to their data,  so we can actually really know what these algorithms are doing and how they're affecting us.  That's a big component of it as well.  It should be complicated. If you had a simple answer, I'd be like, me.

  "transcript": " And oftentimes a common misconception as we are on opposite sides of the table, trying to battle and hammer it out and beat the other side.  With that misconception, people absolutely think negotiations conflict.  But if it's rather us working together and figuring it out as something that creates value for all parties,  even that slight shift in framing in your mind can make it a lot easier to approach negotiation.  Ladies and gentlemen, farmers, ranchers, and distinguished guests.  Thank you for listening to the Farm for Profit Podcast, where we discuss the latest ideas,  methods, trends, and techniques available to help your farm achieve higher levels of farm  profitability.  Remember, if you aren't farming for profit, you won't be farming for long.  Hey listeners, welcome back to the Farm for Profit Podcast.  This is Tanner.  It's Cory.  And Dave's here.  Remember, 5152079640.  That's how you connect with us.  That's how you share ideas for topics and discussions,  just like the one we're talking about today.  The topic we're gonna cover is a repeat topic.  Cover it at three or four different times,  but every time we cover it,  we learn something new and it's important  and much asked for.  Yeah, I feel like it's even though it's covered.  I feel like it's been a while,  just because we have and it's probably gonna be  pretty important going forward here.  It's pretty timely, right?  At least here in the state of Iowa, right Dave?  We have cash rent termination sent out September 1st, September 1st, is that in other states,  two are just Iowa. They are, but other states have different dates. Okay. So it's just timely.  So coming out here in August, just ahead of when that termination date comes, our discussion on  negotiations is going to be very timely. So excited to welcome our guest today. She is, as Dave said,  and the world of negotiation.  A Tia Kureshi.  Get that. Yeah,  listeners. Uh huh. Yeah.  Welcome to the podcast.  Thank you so much for having me.  I am very happy to be here.  You have a lot of unique ties to this topic.  But first of all,  I want to learn about your tie to agriculture  before we go back to your experience in negotiations.  Yes, I actually.  I'm shockingly uniquely suited, I think, for this particular podcast because I joined a farming  family through marriage several years ago.  So my husband is a chariot and apple farmer.  He is six generations.  So now we have a one-year-old son who is seventh generation up here in Northern Michigan.  So I have become deeply imashed in farm life, specifically for fruit farming.  Hmm.  Her buddy Ryan's going to like this too, because he's a big Michigan apple.  Apple girl.  Yes, we've, we just kind of did our six months, you know, what half of the year of 2025  looks like as far as listenership goes in Michigan cracked the top 10 states.  Yes.  Wow.  were a little surprise and appreciative. Yeah. I'll have to start throwing some shade at Michigan.  We never find any bad to say about Michigan. It's always Nebraska.  I'm a lot of farms here in Michigan so I'm glad to hear that you've got listeners.  So you seem surprised that you married into agriculture. I am shocked. So my background is very  business oriented. I went after graduating from University of Michigan. I went and worked  in management consulting out in San Francisco. I worked for a couple of tech startups and  was in the Silicon Valley world in San Francisco and then Denver. And then I ended up  back at MIT in Cambridge to do my masters. And that's where I came across the world of  negotiation and conflict resolution. Absolutely fell in love with it. Thought I would stay there  because there's a huge community of practitioners out there and then I met my husband.  And while I grew up in Southeast Michigan close to Ann Arbor, I didn't expect to be in Michigan  much less rural Michigan on cherry and apple farms. So I am just as surprised as maybe you are  that that's where I ended up, but actually I love it. I do. I can work remotely part of the time.  I can be on the farm in the summer and then I can also travel to my clients for work.  Like Song Says fell for the southern boy draw and overalls or just the rope hat. Maybe just the rope hat.  Oh, it's pretty idyllic.  You miss your ganders have a miss your ganders. Is that for the gander or for the  You're right. It is a michigan.  Really?  Yes.  You guys doubt me.  Come on.  I do know you quite a bit.  Do michiganers have an accent?  Hmm.  I think there's two michigan's, right?  There's the upper peninsula and then there's the upper michigan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's true.  And there's probably different accents there.  Yes.  I would agree with that.  Yep.  I might have her husband on some time to learn how to, you know,  How do you get one of these seed girls to come out out to the farm?  He must be the ultimate negotiate.  I was going to say, honestly, it's true.  I mean, look at the whole thing that he has accomplished and spun together.  You could have a whole podcast on dating, farming, farmer dating life.  They're giving you sponsor there.  Farmers only, that, that, commerce on that.  Negotiation.  Negotiation.  I'm not only did he get her to come to the farm,  but also brought tangible skills  that are extremely valuable to any business.  Yeah.  So let's now kind of unwind.  You did talk high level of your background  and your qualifications on the topic of negotiation.  Let's kind of step through that process  as to how you gain that experience.  Yeah, absolutely.  So I started off within my background  of management consulting and working in Silicon Valley.  I think I started seeing all of the different negotiations  and conflict that took place  within organizations themselves.  And I found that to be fascinating.  And then when I ended up doing my masters at MIT,  I started working with the professor there  who still teaches negotiation.  And I started working with him.  I became his TA.  And then I started consulting with him separately  with corporate clients.  So I started my own consulting practice  where I was building up my base for working  and going into corporate organizations,  a lot of tech organizations,  and then family businesses.  Because I have seen,  I've been part of a family business.  My husband has a family business.  So I have a unique background  when it comes to understanding those even trickier dynamics.  So any organization that's growing quickly,  but within those realms end up being my specialty.  And so I started going through that process  while I was at MIT, built up my consulting practice  and ended up teaching alongside that professor at MIT.  But then, like we mentioned, when my husband came along,  I realized, oh, you can't easily move orchards.  And let me try and see how Michigan works out for me.  And I landed at the University of Michigan.  So I also now teach at the University of Michigan,  specifically teaching master's students  within the public policy school, negotiation,  and conflict resolution skills.  And then another piece of that,  aside from my teaching, my consulting practice,  I've also done conflict resolution and negotiation work  in Columbia with farmers there,  who the government has created a program  trying to get farmers in Columbia  to stop producing coca for cocaine production.  And they're gathering farmers into cooperatives  and subsidizing them to produce other crops,  which is obviously a very high conflict zone  with a lot of very delicate negotiations.  So I've gone there and helped farmers there  and really been in the weeds of it  with them helping them navigate that situation.  Are those negotiations successful?  is a production decreasing?  The production is decreasing.  The farmers are successfully transitioning to other crops.  It certainly isn't a straightforward path though.  There are times where if they don't have the opportunity  to figure out how to work together in a cooperative,  some farmers will just fall off  and go back to coca production,  because it's much more challenging to work together  on a different crop,  Because Cartels will allow you to grow  coca on a small plot of land  and they'll come pick up the coca and just hand you money.  So it's a pretty easy way of crop production,  except that every decade or so they'll come in  and blow down an entire town, if you push back at all  and kind of kill everybody in the town  to remind them that they're in charge.  So that's the downside, which is a pretty intense downside  that a lot of the farmers mentioned to me  as something that really motivated them to transition away.  Well, I didn't expect to talk about that today.  You know, we need to find a different prop here  and I will.  Oh, you gonna start growing?  Can't we grow here?  I don't have to go in my arms.  I'm gonna talk about a new cash market.  I warned you about the downside.  So you can't blame me.  Now we can fight back here, right?  Yeah.  MIT to the University of Michigan.  What?  What an area of college is negotiations.  Like what college program is that?  It's within the business school.  Yeah.  It's a good question.  But my master's program was really interesting.  It was based on user-centered design.  So it was split a little bit.  And I think that gives me a slightly different perspective because user-centered  design focuses on what does the other person need for something to be successful. And that's  really when you tie that to negotiation, you become very successful in a negotiation if you can figure  out what the other side needs. Because no one is going to be okay with a one-sided deal. Even if you  are able to make a handshake deal and it's heavily favored in your side, once you walk away,  are they going to hold up to it or not? So one of the biggest keys in  negotiation is figuring out what's going to work for them and then how do I  integrate that with what works for me? And that was part of my program in my  masters, which I like to incorporate quite a bit with my consulting work.  That makes sense. Dave, you probably deal with negotiations more than any of us  on the land side of things. You're selling stuff all the time. Is that true?  that you got to figure out what the other person  and other party needs once.  Sometimes it's very timely here.  I got a call about eight o'clock last night  from a gentleman we're trying to negotiate an easement with  that basically told me to get men screw off  and I hope you're not trying to make a real estate career  cause I'm gonna crush you.  It was basically the message.  So it turned to a very one-sided conversation  and this is called eminent domain.  We're gonna take it.  That's not a lot of negotiation.  Nope.  We tried. We tried to negotiate. We tried to even offer money cash, try to find out what he wanted.  And it didn't work. And farmers don't like the word, most well-land owners don't like the word  eminent domain. That's a pretty negative connotation. But don't you have to have a reason to use  eminent domain. Correct. Yep. Public benefit. And in this case, the easement gave that benefit there.  Okay.  Interesting.  We get to talk about a lot of things today, but one word that you already brought up is you  get to teach students negotiation skills.  Yeah.  This is something that I think our audience could benefit from as well.  So what are some of the skills that go along when negotiating?  That's a great question.  The framework that I really like to use within negotiation is the seven elements framework.  So if I really briefly go through the seven elements, we start with interests.  So my interests, what do I care about and your interests?  What do you care about?  So David, you were just talking about it with the easement.  I need an easement, the landowner is absolutely not.  I don't want an easement through my property.  Now there are deeper interests there as well.  And so understanding those interests on both parties really helps to figure out how you  you can have a successful negotiation.  Then we also have options.  Options are what can we do together?  Options on the table?  What can we do together to figure out  a way to make the deal work?  Then we have criteria or legitimacy.  What can I bring?  What data can I bring externally  that provides legitimacy to the number  or the offer that I'm making.  We have communication.  So communication is often one we forget about,  which I'll talk about more later,  but how am I communicating to them?  What questions am I asking to get the information  I need from them?  Relationship.  I think one of the biggest misses we have in negotiations,  especially within farming is thinking through relationships  with other people, whether it's vendors,  whether it's big corporations  that we have to work with regularly  or our other farmers and neighbors that we have to work with.  And then we have alternatives and commitment.  So alternatives are off the table.  What do I do if I can't make a deal here?  So again, back to David's quick example,  eminent domain was the alternative.  And then lastly, we have commitment.  So I mentioned this,  But if it's a purely one-sided deal, that often means that people will likely back away from  the deal after you leave the table.  So how are you making sure that both parties uphold the deal that has been committed to?  So that is an example here.  Yeah, please.  So in this scenario, you said what was the first one?  Interesting.  Interesting.  So in this case, the neighboring farmer was also wanted by the farm that we were selling.  He was not the high bidder.  We sold it to someone else.  So when we sold someone else,  of course, then that made him bristle up  that no, he does not want to give an easement  across his property.  We found out that his interest was  that he did not want somebody developing back there.  So we tried to negotiate with him and say,  tell you what, let's make an easement  and we'll write in the easement  that guaranteed nobody will develop back there.  So we tried to appeal to what he was looking for.  Oh yeah, and he didn't want any corporate hunting.  So okay, we wrote in the easement, no corporate hunting.  We're really just using this for our own, you know, for the guy that was buying it.  Move forward.  Okay, we got a deal.  shook a hand.  There was money involved.  We ended up getting eminent domain committee.  They normally determined what is this worth?  So we got outside opinions of what is this worth, which you kind of mentioned.  And at that committee meeting, we basically made a handshake deal that, okay, let's do it,  because he'd rather have the interest of not commercial developments in the back rather than  eminent domain telling him what he can do.  But then we left the table.  It's been four and a half weeks, and we have no answer,  no signed documents, no anything.  So we're back to you have one week, otherwise we're  going back to eminent domain.  So the commitment was weak.  The commitment was weak.  Yeah.  You know, it's interesting what you started off with.  And this is a little bit of the relational piece,  but also deeply understanding his interests.  Underneath the relationship and interests  are often emotions.  And we can forget about the emotion that comes into play with an negotiation.  So what you said is really fascinating to me where he wanted to buy the property,  but didn't end up being able to.  He was the highest bidder.  So he's holding resentment to that.  And then not only was he not the highest bidder,  but this new owner gets to come through his property.  So it's a little bit of a double whammy probably to his pride.  And that sitting deep inside of him, not getting resolved or addressed, makes it so he's putting  roadblock after roadblock up in your negotiation.  I was going to use the term stone walling.  That's where we're at.  Well, and this is like when you decided that you wanted to start selling farms, do you think  that you would ever be negotiating or try for an easement?  Your job is to sell the farm, not get an easement.  That's correct.  Lots of hats you wear. Yeah. That's crazy. Wow. So those seven elements are some of the key pillars  that you teach in in your curriculum to these business students. Now right now Corey, right?  You were we're talking about contracts that you've got in place that provides you some upside.  As far as grain sales goes, we know this year, a tee that we are probably looking at a good crop,  Maybe not such great prices and some of the information that we have on our side  indicates that inputs are still going to be relatively expensive compared to the  value of the crop that we're growing. Corey would you say it's important now more  than ever or is it just always important to be a good negotiator? Well that's  always important it's if you take the grain marketing mentality right once  the corn seven dollars everybody's making money when corn's four dollars you  You can make money, but there's, you got to try a lot harder.  But why shouldn't you go get that lot?  What, I mean, if you could market it for 730 instead of 690, you know, you're making better  decisions for your farm.  You're being more profitable.  It's just as important in your operation.  Where do you think you have the most ability to negotiate?  Um, inputs, there's negotiation skills.  the grain marketing side, right? Chicago Board of Trade, set the price. But you can decide  who you sell to, when you sell it, and you can, if you have good relationships with your grain  buyers, the posted basis is not the basis that you can get. You can almost always get a better  basis. Okay. Now on the Apple and Cherry side, is it the same? Like that? Or are there more  opportunities when you go to sell the good.  There are more opportunities because it's not posted in the same way. Now what's  interesting is that there are two markets. There's the processing market and there's the  fresh market. So the processing market is the one that you can sell more volume to because they're  processing the fruit for frozen cherries or cherry products or applesauce, for example. And then  the fresh market is going to the grocery stores. So when you have an intermediary with the  processing market, which unfortunately has consolidated, which we have seen, right recently  for my husband, that creates a really big problem because with the consolidation, they can  squeeze the farmers incredibly low on the price per pound. So much so that in the past couple  years we have one big processor left in the Midwest, the rest are out in California, and a lot  of farmers are getting out of the business because they've just gotten squeezed way too low.  And interestingly, a lot of times that happens when you have private equity companies coming in.  They really try to squeeze the margins out of businesses that they see just like this one.  and my husband was what we call 100% grower.  So they had committed 100% of their processing crop to this processor.  But the processor doesn't make a commitment back other than to buy the product, but not giving  a commitment to the price.  And they just go lower and lower and lower and lower at a point where it's not even  worth producing it anymore.  So one of the things I didn't hear you say in your seven steps, if we refer back to Donald  Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, he talks about leverage.  I didn't hear anywhere that you said leverage in there and what I just heard from your last  comments was they leveraged people right out of the business because they could.  And in Corgendstence, if the farmland owner can leverage the fact that somebody else will  buy it, somebody else will rent it.  that keeps cash rent price high. So although there's leverage on the side of the  grower that says, look, I can't I can't do this anymore at this price. There might be  other people that will step in your place and rent that ground from you. So it's a it's  a very touchy subject when it comes to farmers, you don't want to step on others toes,  but there's normally five guys right behind you that'll that'll probably pick up that  cash ran at the level that you were dropping.  That's that's exactly true and it's really I think that that concept is  fascinating the idea of leverage because  the  processor for example, it feels like they have all of the power in this situation, but  This year for example has been a really tricky growing year  There was a late freeze with the crop so a lot of people lost their crop and then there was hail  So for a lot of, at least Michigan and in the Midwest in general, a lot of people lost their  entire crop. So now the processor is in a bind because they're not getting the volume they  need for production. So they've actually come back to my husband asking if he will sell to them  at a significantly higher price than they've offered in the last five years. So leverage  exists, but it doesn't always exist.  And I think that farmers in particular have a much longer term view than any other industry I've ever seen.  I've worked with several other industries and farmers just have to have a longer term view than any other organization, which means that they have to be much more strategic.  And with that long-term view, these PE companies, I think they come in and they don't realize that.  Because you don't know about the cycles within farming the way that farmers do.  And the piece that I think combats leverage is relationship.  Because if you use your leverage and destroy relationships and eventually people always come back around,  you always need someone.  Even if you burn the bridge with them back in the day, I've learned, especially in farming,  people always come back around. The need is always there at some point in another.  It might not be for five years, but your six or seven, it shows up again.  And I think that that's what, you know, I mentioned at the beginning, relationships we  forget about them in negotiations, but they're so incredibly important, especially in farming,  because of that long-term view.  Yeah, I was going to highlight the, I think, relationships is probably one of the most important  in farming. Whether good or bad. I mean, I've heard stories of don't ever rent the farm to this  family because great grandpa screwed great the other great grandpa in some poker game,  you know, like generations ago, but they're still holding the garage.  But you've brought us up multiple times. I mean, Cory's our CTO, you know, Chief Talent Officer,  but I think he could be farm for profits, Chief Relationship Officer, because that's something that  that you've demonstrated is a huge value to our team early on.  Because, but I'm terrible at negotiations.  You are, but you hold that piece.  You hold that piece of leverage, though,  that you've identified that important person  to have a relationship with,  with a lot of our advertisers.  And it sounds like you're doing the same thing  with your grain buyers because what I wrote down  when Dave brought up leverage was,  when does the farmer gain leverage?  Mm.  You kind of described weather as one thing.  But outside of that, I mean, the only other leverage you have for your corn and soybeans  is instead of going to ADM and Des Moines, you could go to Iowa Falls.  I would fall.  You could go to the elevator.  That's like the only leverage you have is you can take it to multiple.  A little less on the bean side, but corn a lot more ethanol plants and end users.  I guess.  There's some other leverage techniques out there for the farmer.  I've had specific people called or rent farms.  I only want to rent to an organic guy.  So now the organic guys have leverage  over all of the commercial producers  because the mentality that the landowner, absentee landowner,  maybe I'll use California or Texas or Vermont or ever,  they've read something and they want organic.  They want nothing sprays.  So now you have a leg up.  If you're utilizing programs like carbon intensity score,  45Z or any of that to where you might be able to have a leg up, you can use that as leverage to  Outdo the the neighbor farmer you might be able to get a little bit more  But that's because you're studying the programs  Right, it's interesting. What do you think about that atia?  Well, I think that's really fascinating because what I hear is  You're identifying a unique value proposition for your farm and there are a lot of different ways to do that  So when I was talking about my husband with the processing, he's pivoted to the fresh market.  But specifically, his value proposition is really high quality and local.  So those are a couple of items that people at least would improve farming really care about.  But I love what David's saying, where you can think about organic.  You can think, I mean, local might still apply in certain aspects for other farming businesses.  based on your practices and utilizing energy programs.  There are a lot of different ways to set yourself apart  to showcase value in a slightly different way,  but then I would also circle back to what Corey said  about relationships.  That provides leverage as well.  Because if you are the person that people like to deal with  and you are reliable and trustworthy  and you follow through on your commitments,  that in itself is huge leverage too.  because people want to work with that type of person.  They don't want someone who is chaotic and changes all the time.  And yeah, we get a good price this year, but what happens next year?  So I've brought up several things on the more the input and the sales side.  But I think probably the biggest thing you're wanting to get out of this,  what I guess I don't know, but I'm guessing is probably rent negotiations or land negotiations.  Well, one thing that Etienne and I talked about that has worked really well for  farm for profit in our listeners in the past is to kind of go through a couple of examples.  And I do think cash rent land availability is one that we should jump into as a specific way.  How can we potentially gain some experience today for those types of conversations?  So for the listeners that are not in the Midwest to kind of set the table, you know,  in Iowa, at least in our area, cash rent negotiations typically happen when at least termination  is delivered prior to September 1st and or in a relationship with your landlord, you know,  in amongst those times.  Dave sells a farm into a new landowner if their absentee has to find a potentially new  tenant to negotiate those terms.  But cash rent gives you access to that farm route.  Cash rent or access to that land comes in various different ways.  cash, exchange of bushels, crop share percentage of some kind, and flex, flex lease, and  any in all of the between.  So just to kind of set that table, that's what we want to talk through here.  So TF, we think about, we've got a landlord that we've known for just a couple of years.  Relatively new, we might be short on the relationships side of things.  They just served us termination notice with the intent to raise our cash rent.  two things I want to premise because you get a termination doesn't mean that they actually  want to terminate you. A lot of times it does but it just means that they want to come back to  the table to negotiate, like go up or down or whatever. You as a farmer can serve least termination  because you want to renegotiate, right? And then I want to say there's probably two different land  owners. There's probably the absentee land owner that's very, absentee or very far removed  from agriculture, very money driven. And then there's also is the people that are still very  tied to the small towns and around the area and are more probably relationship driven. So  there's a couple different things that delayed out there. And just because the termination  is served in Iowa anyway for your listeners, September 1st is when it's served by and  signed, but most leases go March to March.  So it doesn't mean you're kicked off the property right now.  It means in next March, renegotiate something before that.  Yeah.  So what would you suggest, our listeners?  We've received this notice and now what would be a best first step for us to try and start  with a leg up?  Yes.  I have three of the seven elements that are crossing my mind.  I have relationship, I have criteria or the legitimacy piece,  and then I also have interests.  Now I want to-  I want to-  Sorry.  You missed the one I thought you were gonna say, keep going.  Which one are you thinking?  Communication.  Oh yes, yes, communication.  Well, it's interesting, I often tie,  that's a great one.  often tie communication directly into interests because communication is  actually so crucial in understanding what they want. That's that's actually  your spot on, but I end up merging those two. So first I want to take a step back.  I understand that we are light on relationship. If there is an opportunity, I would  say knowing that these notices can get served, starting late summer fall,  What can we do winter, spring and summer to build that relationship?  Now, it sounds like it's a lot easier with someone who has the ties to the small town.  But the opportunity still exists with the absentee landowner.  And I would urge listeners to think about what am I going to do starting this winter,  thinking about the fact that this might come up for me next September?  Because I think there's a huge opportunity to have that forethought and be prepared for the next September.  I understand that we're coming up to September right now and I will address that, but I do think it's also valuable to be thinking about it once you do sign your lease for the next year.  Whether you are with the absentee landowner thinking through how to make connections with them,  Are you keeping sending them updates?  Are you communicating with them to understand what they care about?  What type of updates would they want?  What type, you know, is there anything that you can send them?  We talk about within relationship building the idea of reciprocity and I can't tell you  how powerful it is just to send a holiday card.  It is incredibly impactful.  There is a study that was done that there was a, they sent out their family sent out holiday  cards to people.  They didn't know, 100 people.  They didn't know.  They just sent a holiday card.  And I can't remember the percentage, but a massive percentage of them started sending  holiday cards back even though they didn't know each other.  But the idea of reciprocity is so powerful that they were like, Oh my gosh, we're getting  this card.  And we have to respond.  So just small things like that up front and thinking about can I send them, you know, if  I'm a bean farmer, can I send them some cool beans?  Like in a cute jar or a holiday card?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just it's really powerful and it doesn't have to be expensive but small items  that build that relationship can go a huge way.  So then...  Well, while we're on that topic, can I interject here?  I'm hearing is retention. We do a lot of fundraising with my auction firm and we always talk about donor retention.  They gave last year the relationship was good. How do we keep that relationship going? So maybe  address it while you're on it. How does Corey keep the relationships other than a gift or a  Christmas card? Is there such a thing as tenant retention? I would I would say other than small  gifts and a holiday card communication is massive. Right? What type of communication do  they appreciate? Do they want to know from Corey? Like this is, you know, a quick update.  This is what we're doing during the winter season. This is what we're doing during the  spring season. It's actually amazing to me for especially absentee landowners. How much  they like to be kept in the loop a small way about farming practices because it makes them  feel a little bit like a farmer. And they like that.  For reason that I started a Facebook page. I got that in my notes before really anyone was starting  Facebook farm pages. Like before Zach Johnson was putting stuff on YouTube. I was like,  I need to start documenting this because in the reason being was because I started writing a newsletter  for my landlords and had pictures and all that. I sent a few out. I'm like, why don't I just post this  daily and then everyone can watch right not just my landlords they can keep up but they get that  I had wrote I had wrote that down because the very first interview that we had Corey on the podcast was  because of his social media and what he was doing with that family page and then when you mentioned  the newsletter it was quite interesting because if somebody wants to be attached to the farm  yeah it's extra work for you maybe you your spouse your team member whatever it is but how cool  would it be if you're a land owner, Dave, to get an email that said,  crops planted in the ground, we got that there.  This is the best soils worked up in years.  We also had two inches of rain over the last 30 days.  And by the way, my kid broke her foot.  You know, whatever your newsletter is.  And now all of a sudden, you're not a number.  What I do as a farm manager is I actually started doing,  if you have a drone, or you should do this,  you can use the panoramic feature.  And it's like a 3D walkthrough tour of the house.  How do we make the absentee land on our feel like they're on the farm?  Is do a panoramic drone picture after the crops are planted?  So I let them see fields,  zoom travel around the farm virtually through a software  so that they get a drift of what was planted,  even though they're not there.  Farms really wet.  It needs tile, we need to lower the tree.  Yeah, no.  Right.  I love this.  I feel like I'm learning a lot that I'm gonna take back  to my husband from this.  But that's exactly right.  You all know exactly how to keep people engaged  and that engagement and those touch points  are so beneficial to the idea of retention  that you're saying.  Okay, so we've identified that there's a lot  that we can be doing ahead of time  to kind of build up that relationship,  understand their interests,  and figure out that the criteria for this,  not to kind of wrap up this topic.  We're into negotiations right now.  Yes. We're in it.  We've identified that relationship out the window,  it matters about dollars.  Yep. What advice do you have for a grower?  That is pretty much utilized every tool you can think of,  and now it's just down to dollars.  Yep. That's a great question.  So this comes to understanding their interests and the combination of that  communication and then criteria or the legitimacy. So first, asking questions to understand  what they are looking for is incredibly powerful. Because if they want to renegotiate this contract,  the more information we can get the better. Where are you trying to end up?  What, you know, what is the purpose of this renegotiation? What are you looking for when it comes to  to the land itself, trying to understand, yes,  you know, they want a higher rent.  But is there anything else they care about?  Because if we come back to that idea of leverage,  are there pieces that we can add in  that create value for them that is not expensive for us?  Because while it does come to dollars,  and again, back to the idea of leverage,  but underneath the idea with relationship,  people have emotional needs as well.  So what emotional needs do they have in addition to the dollars?  Do they have a kid who loves tractors?  I mean, honestly,  I don't know a kid who doesn't love tractors.  Let's fair.  You're like, you're like, you're like,  you're like, I'm right here.  Exactly.  And is that something that you wanna visit the farm?  Like, can we give you a really cool farm tour?  I, there are so many different things  underneath the negotiation.  if you can ask questions to understand what the other person cares about, other than the dollar.  So figuring out those pieces and how you might be able to meet different needs for them that  meet more than just the dollar number can add a ton of value to an negotiation.  But let's talk about when you get to the dollar itself because at the end of the day,  while all those pieces can make a difference in the negotiation, the dollar matters.  Cori is that way you got your chemical applicator's license to become a pool boy for all your old lady tennis that you  The pool boy slash farmer  That's the next  So let's let's and when it comes to the dollar itself I find this idea of legitimacy or criteria or external data to be incredibly powerful  I actually find it powerful in any negotiation because we can all get really nervous in an negotiation.  Corey said, you know, I'm great on the relational side, but I hate I'm really bad at the negotiation piece.  And we can, we all to a certain extent feel anxiety around a negotiation.  And what can help suit that anxiety is figuring out what externally, what data is available to help me figure out what's fair?  Because at the end of the day, people want to feel like they're getting a fair deal.  They want to feel like they are coming to terms that maybe not is perfect for everybody,  but feels fair to everybody.  So give me an example of a per acre value range.  Well, just in case our landlords are listening, it's like $180.  That's 200.  That's good.  I have an average in Iowa that it's about $285 per acre  on most of the good ground.  And we do have a couple of resources just to clean in Iowa State  University puts out a land values survey for cash rent,  a cash rent survey every year.  And many of many of you are behind.  Landlords use that.  But as a guy that does it on the other side, sometimes I don't  feel it's up to date.  And then some landlords don't either.  And they start calling.  Go ahead.  Yeah, sure first I have ever heard Dave say around.  Ever.  I've never heard you say around under 300.  It's $4 must be coming down.  $4 for CSR.  Okay.  Yep.  Okay.  So I actually love that because that itself is that.  External data that people can go and find because who can argue with Iowa state saying,  hey, we are doing this research as is that we are doing this research as a institution  And we are coming up with this number that we think is fair.  And that's just a starting point. It doesn't have to be where you end up.  But there's probably a range around that 285 number. So perhaps with really profitable,  really high value land, it can be higher or with poorer soil, it could be lower.  So what you find is a range. So maybe that range ends up being 250 to 350 just for the sake of  our examples. Now, I say, I would say does give you a range for low, medium, and high  I quote amazing and for county my problem with their deal is it's a survey surveys are people's opinions and I want factual data  So if I took to an option there's sending that to people that either cash rent ground or cash rent their ground out  So by law of averages you can have people go in and put outliers  Hi and low because I know where you're going with this because he's gonna say little ladies have little sweetheart  deals with their with their son or their grandson or whatever. And it's only 100 bucks.  And you've got farmers that you also have farmers that are paying 500 to guys like you  managing farms wanting all the dollars. So it all averages out of the end. Right. That's  where you come to know. I was going to say the farmers that don't want to survey numbers  to be high for when it comes out and they purposely report low to. Yeah. I was in there too.  Going to know I wish we had an average as though not opinions. Yeah. I understand that.  And I don't know if there's availability.  My husband actually had to look at some data for this exact reason last year for understanding  farm land lease value.  And he went to a couple of different sources.  He went to someone who does property assessments, so trying to understand.  He does it specifically for property.  What is the value of this property?  We also went to an agricultural economist who has his PhD saying, hey, what do you think  land value is based on your understanding?  So what he did was found a few different pieces of data.  And that can help supplement the single source.  So iOS state has one piece of data, but there are, are there a couple of other pieces that  you can use to supplement it?  Because that could help you further define your range.  So if Iowa State's range is 250 to 350, but then all of a sudden you get more information  and it ends up being 200 to 500, that's really helpful.  Now here's where the negotiation comes in because if you are the farmer who's trying to  get the best price for the lease and of course the landowner is trying to get the best  price, but a lot of people don't do their research this diligently.  So first step when it comes to figuring out the number and coming in strong is doing the  research to get the data.  And so I'm the farmer and I want to negotiate a really good rate.  I know the range is 200 to 500.  I'm coming in with that I'm coming in at the lowest end of the range or whatever end of  the range is best for me.  And we call that anchoring.  We call it anchoring and I am anchoring the negotiation at $200.  And I can support that number because I have background and data that I can share comfortably  share to support it.  Now of course it's going to be a discussion because they're coming back with a different  perspective.  But you know that what's fair is somewhere in that range and you also know it's not the  best quality land.  So you're going to narrow that range to really be from 200 to 350 because it's just not  high quality enough to hit the other part.  So you have your range, you're starting at the range that's most beneficial to you and  you're narrowing that range on what makes sense based on different parameters.  So now you have a scope for the negotiation and a price point to work within.  But the power of anchoring means that you're starting from 200.  If you let them start, you might be starting from 400 and you're trying to chip away from  400.  But now they're trying to raise you from 200.  And so you might end up at 250.  But if you start at 400, are you going to end up at 350 instead?  Right.  Is there a factor of respect like you could actually low ball them and make them mad?  I'm anchoring down here hoping to get a little bit higher than that, but you piss them off and they should go away.  Yes. And that's where I think that you want, if you do anchoring, you want to anchor them within the data.  So you don't want to anchor them at a point that doesn't, isn't supported by data.  Because if you can provide the supporting evidence for why 200 could make sense, I don't think they're going to be upset with you.  If you anchor at 150, but you don't have any supporting evidence, absolutely.  They could throw out their hands and be like, I don't think that.  Yeah, we're up and off.  Yeah, exactly.  But you're not ripping them off because you're providing external data to support your number.  Interesting.  Well, I have already appreciate that you've added more clarity to some of these thought  processes than what we've had in the past.  Because I think some of the interviews we've done in the past,  we've gone straight to, well, if you can't negotiate the dollar, maybe you can offer a longer  contract. Or if you can't do a longer contract and the dollar is not negotiable, maybe you can say,  I'm only going to do half of it in March and half of it in December or whatever it is to manipulate.  So our listeners have already heard that advice. So this is neat to kind of think of,  There's still external factors even when the negotiation seems like it's only about dollars.  Let me bridge off of what Corey was saying and give an example and see what your thoughts are on this.  I had a client the other day that came to me and said, hey, we would like a number on the farm.  So as an appraiser, we give them a number of, we give them a range, a high-medium low,  based on comparable sales.  I don't know which number they chose, the high medium or the low.  They went to the tenant and said, would you like to buy it?  Prior to hiring us as a real estate firm.  Happens all the time.  So I literally just gave them the info they needed to go sell it by themselves.  They went to the tenant and said, hey tenant, will you buy it?  And this is where we've had this conversation before, who fires first?  Okay? And they said, make us an offer.  Well, they made an offer.  And it was at the bottom end of the range of where I gave them.  So then they called us back and they said, hey, go ahead and list the farm.  We listed the farm.  Well, sure enough, the same tenant offered us money.  Of course, realtors take a commission in the middle.  So we took a commission in the middle and they came up to the top price.  So I talked to both sides of it and I said, why didn't you just come up?  If you were willing to give that much to start with, why didn't you just come up?  Well, I mean, we tried to have a communication, but they really didn't tell us what they wanted.  And we would have gave that much, but they never really asked for it.  And so back to communication, I think if they'd have had a conversation,  that's why I become in the middle as the realtor is the communicator between both of them.  But then I'm the martyr because I'm the guy taking commission in the middle.  I think oftentimes that if one would lay it out, lay your cards on the table.  And I think we've had this in a conversation before.  Lay your cards on the table to let them know what our expectations are.  If Corey wants rent a farm, I can't give $400.  I will give you $350.  That's where I think it's worth.  But set that expectation, then they can come back and say, well,  I don't want to lose you, but I want at least 380.  I don't think people are having that conversation.  I don't know if they are.  Maybe some of the better guides are, but not  that I didn't want the commission on it.  But we got more for the seller because the tenant wouldn't pony up to the money that they want to start with.  If the tenant would have just pony'd up start with, do it would have been done.  Well, what's really interesting there, if you don't mind me chiming in is, you know,  the tenant made a low ball offer, but the seller may not have gone back and asked,  what's the best you can do?  which is really interesting because I think you're right a lot of David that there may not be that  conversation happening where we have a number out there and because we don't like to negotiate,  sometimes people aren't even willing to talk about the number and have the conversation and so  if I had been the tenant and the seller had said no thanks like I think we're going to list it,  I would have gone back and asked them, where are you looking to be? Right? It goes back to  understanding their interests and asking the question about where they want to be. Because I would  go back and say, I would like to try to figure this out with you. And if we can avoid having a real  turn falls, who's going to take a margin out of that thought to be. Exactly. That would be great  for us and value for both of us to split. I think that's why there is realtors on houses on land  and everything is because people don't like to negotiate.  Yeah, in this case, I do believe that the sellers didn't want to have the confrontation  with their long-term tenant. They wanted their long-term tenant to buy it,  but they wanted someone else to help them set a price. We get behind me,  them in low, and they didn't really low-low-ball. They came in with them,  like you said, the anchor. They came in with them, the data.  But the seller said, well, could we get this? Well, I think we can,  based on comparable sales data, well, sure enough, it did. It was once what somebody was willing to  give but oftentimes we never show our cards of what we're willing to give. I so on the topic of  show your cards though. And we'd be to transparent? Yes, absolutely. I mean, absolutely. I think  let me let me touch upon what David said and then I will come up to the idea of transparency.  It's really interesting David that you said people don't like the conflict. Often times people  equate negotiation to conflict. But with the seven elements, I find that the whole methodology  is creating value for both parties. And so the way I like to think about it is us working  together on a negotiation, right? So it's us working almost as a team collaboratively to figure  this negotiation out. And oftentimes a common misconception is we are on opposite sides of  the table trying to battle and hammer it out and beat the other side. With that  misconception, people absolutely think negotiations conflict. But if it's  rather us working together and figuring it out as something that creates value  for all parties, even that slight shift in framing in your mind can make it a lot  easier to approach negotiation. Now, Tanner, I'll flip back to what you asked about  being too transparent, I would not advise you ever share the maximum or minimum, depending  on what you're doing, that you're willing to go.  You have a number and you should certainly know what range you're willing to work in.  So I think this is really interesting as well with buyers.  So for example, people go and look at a house and they have a budget, right?  We're gonna do it attractor.  We're gonna do it attractor.  We're gonna do it attractor.  Let's look at attractor.  Let's say we're coming to look at a used tractor.  And we've got a budget of about $50,000.  We're going and we're looking at it and it looks pretty good and it drives well and it has  good navigation and GPS systems in it.  And all of a sudden we're paying $65,000 for that tractor.  Why?  One thing that we don't necessarily do before entering an negotiation is thinking through  what our own range is in a pretty strict way.  So this happens all the time in negotiations where if we don't define what our own interests  are and what our range is, we can easily go outside of it because we haven't anchored  ourselves. This happens with a lot of different purchases where we get swept up in things  and we don't define the value of them and all of a sudden we're overpaying. And so we need  to know what it is that makes sense for us within our budget and what makes sense within  the data. So we're not going into that situation. And even if you can pay 65,000 dollars,  I don't want you to go and let them know you can pay that. And I don't want you to pay  that if that's not what market rate is because if market is 50 to 60, you should not be  paying that extra five. But is something market what somebody's willing to give?  That's what you're saying. You're going to get salesperson to get the sunroof.  They think they've got to hire. Buyers always give you the negatives. Each new tires, they're  all worn down. It's got 10,000 hours and then the seller always say brand new paint, fresh  motor, etc. You know, they tell the positives, they tell the negatives and it's the amicable  communication in the middle. The problem is that we don't communicate even at an auction,  one side of conversation, this is why I like an auction. Take her house model for a second.  I'm a realtor and I represent Corey and Corey says, man, I'm willing to go this  time, but I can't tell that to the other realtor. And we just, we keep in mind that close  door here, you can't, you can't. I can't tell you what's wrong. They'll offer them this. They'll  off for this. And then the other  ruler is like, oh, they won't take this.  And if we'd all just sit at the same  blueman table and have a conversation  or in an auction setting, hey, they want more.  You want to give a little more? Yes or no?  Yes or no? Boom.  Hashtag auctions work. Didn't you send me a  TikTok the other day?  It was a wife's perspective.  The husband went to an auction.  Yeah. She was ranting about how they  decided they were going to get their  finances in order and he went  on a tractor. Went to the auction just to  look. He came back with a tractor.  granted it was a 4020 so it couldn't have been it couldn't have been how it landed  still it was good I mean they're budget and so then the next week you wanted to go to another  auction and she sat him down and here's your budget here's your budget yeah they in this even  though you shouldn't have spent money in the last time and it yeah it was a humorous  well tiktok but I get where you're coming from what staying on that topic of attractor  you know Corey has a theory for buying things off of marketplace facebook marketplace negotiations  You want to know what?  But in agriculture, I think we find ourselves  negotiating with peers.  How many more often than most businesses because  the asset value and asset exchanges.  So to give you Corey's anchoring advice.  He says piss them off first with the canned is this available?  Yes, you still will respond.  And then Corey says you take the asking price, cut it in half and add $50 to it.  So if it's $10,000 item, you offer $5,050 and say, would you take that?  See, I do it down.  I do similar, but I do it with more people.  I'll have 10 of my best friends call them at different times and they'll all offer about  60% maybe 65% of the time I call it 75, they pour them down to where it's like, damn,  this is the best offer I got to 10 people today. Let's take it.  Oh my gosh, that's amazing because what you're doing is you are creating your own competitive  market. So what you're having them think is the objective criteria that people are showing  me is 60% and this guy is coming up above market. So what you're doing is create your  market right you're manipulating the market which is illegal I think  Like farm for profit. There's no UCC  I'm new service. You know we've got our patriotic out. We've got listeners and well  I've never been a buddy's call on your farm equipment. Yeah if you we should offer a service  So for a low fee farm for profit will get 10 or 12 people to call on a listing  So if you want to buy a combine or for cash or in we'll call your tenant will offer away less money  Hey, I'm willing to do it, but the most I can afford is there.  I'm sending $5.  Yeah, yeah.  Make you look like a shining star.  Yeah, and if one of you happened to get it for that low,  you get a commission on top of that.  I think we could make this work first.  All right, I want to reel back in and do what Tanner does.  How big.  OK, so we're talking tractor share.  When someone goes and buys a tractor from a tractor dealer,  normally, both people know what the tractor is.  When someone goes once to buy farmland from David,  They normally know farms, the people selling it.  No, the farm usually.  Dave knows the farm.  When we're talking cash rent negotiations,  a lot of times these are people that have been removed  from the farm several generations  and have little to no idea of what's going on besides,  I get a check every March and I get a check every November.  How big is education in this factor?  I mean, from the tenant?  Yeah, both sides, but yeah.  Okay.  I would say it's huge because what you're doing is educating them with that objective  criteria that you found, with that external data.  You're letting them know what the marketplace is showing as the value.  And I would also say that people really care about the why.  So giving them a little bit of information on what the market's doing and how that impacts  the land value can be really helpful as well.  for example, like you're saying margins are getting squeezed down and it's a good crop, but  the prices aren't going to be great. That information can be really relevant to a landowner  so that they can understand the situation that you as a farmer are in.  Would you actually bring some of your finances in? Maybe not like fine detail, but like for this  acre or generalities. This is what it's going to cost my crop in the ground. This is what the  the average yields are for this soil type or this field, this area. Like I'm  at it, I'm looking at breaking even. Right. Yeah. I think that's absolutely fine to  do at a high level. I think that's really valuable for them to see, you know,  this, these are my costs. These are my inputs. This is what I can get out of it.  And then this is what I'm trying to pay you and at least. And I need to figure out  how to be able to make enough margin to keep going. Yeah. I know you hate farm  managers but I actually I actually had a client that they  wanted to raise the rent this year and I did not think the  break even was going to be there so I advise them so sometimes  a third party you know comment on the outside can help  to because it was already negative to start it was a story  Dave just made up this is not the reason so the reason I'm  asking here is like if you are removed from the farm in your  ground dollars is your biggest factor, right? Like not a lot of feel good if you're doing it organic  whatever, I mean it's dollars and what they probably go into is what the landmark it is doing and  if you follow what the landmark it is doing for buying ground it has not followed commodities.  So there's a little bit of emotion in farmland so I'm curious what your thoughts are on this.  If we're selling something,  Farmline's a different asset than a combine.  If I want another combine, I can go to XYZ auction company  and buy a combine tomorrow.  The next day of my checkbook is not there.  I can go buy it next week or two months from now  or after taxes or whenever, two years.  We can plan.  What does Iowa State tell us?  62 years, I think it is.  Every 62 years we trade hands on land.  So when that farm comes up next to us for sale,  there's less negotiation because I'm not going to have the opportunity to buy this asset  in my lifetime. Again, scarcity. Scarcity. It's not, it's not there. So we tend to put a little  bit of more emotion into it and spend more money, which then inflates that farmland market.  But then as speculators come in and say, well, this is going to go up. But if rent is following  the farmland market, rent doesn't have the same emotion that it can because when you're  it has to pay. You're not doing it for charity to lose.  If you're coming in and buying ground for too much money,  either made the money beforehand and you're supplementing other acres,  or you're speculating because towns 10 miles away and you think in 25 years,  it's going to be worth double, driple, whatever.  Well, you have so much money that you just want to write off on being green.  Possibly.  I think that's a problem that every farmer wish they had.  But you know, when you talk, start talking land 15, $20,000 an acre.  And then you got these people that don't really know much about farming, but own the land.  I want 3%.  I want 4%.  I can go get 5% on my CD or whatever.  Yeah, it just doesn't work that way because there's so many other moving factors to make  money on that land.  So either figure out something else to grow.  And what's your thoughts on this?  Like, what would you tell our listeners,  I had a guy the other day, so we just did a job.  Okay, so I'm having a different negotiation.  I'm bidding a job.  And I said my percent, I'll just make stuff up.  I'll say it was 10%.  And the guy says, we won't do it for 10%,  but we will hire you at 7%.  So then I have to.  So now the lines have been drawn.  I asked, and this is not the scenario.  He asked seven, and I said, look, I know what I'm worth.  and I'm not doing it for the practice anymore.  It takes nine or I'm out.  So eventually I had to say what my expectations were.  It's 9% or I'm out.  And he said, you know what, I'll do it.  9% as a farmer, I think we have to say that.  Look, I can't make me there.  Get rid of the farm and be out or I can afford to do it  at 300 bucks an acre, whatever.  What's your opinion on that?  I think that at the end of the day,  that's what we're talking about with alternatives  is at a certain point we get  to this position where we can't go any further, right?  We have our, we call it the zone of possible agreement.  There's a zone in which we can make a deal.  And so you're saying, you know, you started at seven and 10,  seven percent, 10 percent.  That was the zone.  And you narrowed the zone and you were like,  listen, I actually cannot make this work.  The zone is nine to 10 now.  You, you drew a line through the rest of the zone.  At a certain point, it is important to say what it is your limit is.  And even asking them, why, you know, what is your interest here in owning this farmland?  Because there isn't, you know, there aren't huge returns in a lot of these row crops.  And I would love to better understand from you the value of this land to you because I,  And here's the value to me.  So sharing the value that you get  and then understanding from them,  what is the value you're getting out of this?  Because I wanna be able to make it work,  but this is the range that it truly can work in.  And if you do get to a point of alternatives,  it can be helpful to share those alternatives  almost as a disclosure,  because people can get very defensive  when it comes to a rubbing point,  where you're looking at a moment where it might not work  and what happens if we have to walk away  and what happens if someone is offering me more or less.  And sharing that as a, you know,  I wasn't going to bring this up  because I want to be able to make a deal work with you  and I wanna make sure that it works for all parties,  but someone has offered me a higher price.  So I'm hoping we can figure out a range in which this makes sense for both of us,  sharing that in a very delicate way can be powerful.  I always recommend doing that later on once you've done the other pieces of building a relationship  and you're understanding their interests, communicating effectively,  thinking through all the options available to all parties.  But at a certain point, you will get down the line to that moment of this work,  or this doesn't work.  And what do we do then?  I get a couple more questions.  Email, phone, try to have a personal meeting with them,  or letter, is there one that's better than another?  Great question.  I think every negotiation, I have a hierarchy  when it comes to negotiations.  Top is in person if you can.  Because again, we're relational and half of communication  is body language.  So having that body language and having open body language  that showcases that you want to work together with them  is really beneficial.  Second would be video chat,  because at least you have the sum  of that body language coming through.  Third would be over the phone  because you still have intonation in your voice.  So you can still convey some tone  and some warmth in your voice of wanting to work together.  I would stop right there.  I would not negotiate any other way  Because, and you might want to confirm things when it comes to the idea of commitment in  negotiation, you would of course want it in writing, but when you're actually going and having  the back and forth, doing it in any other written form, because you don't have any emotion  or any intonation or conveying any of the emphasis behind what you're saying.  The way we read words is how we feel in that moment.  So if they're having a bad day, they are reading your negotiation letter in the worst form  possible and they're reading every line as a, like, this guy is yelling at me.  This, uh, that hits home a lot.  Very much.  We're going to see if Rachel listens to this whole episode because that was her and I yesterday.  She was texting her.  I was I was apparently mad because that's the way it was read. Oh  Yeah, she I had this in back saying there is no angry tone in this text. Yeah, I'm probably made it worse  Here's here's my happy font. Yeah  Probably made it worse. Okay. Next question for our listeners lots of young listeners  They want to rent more ground  You said a normal I would say hey Corey go send letters. Here's a list of every neighbor farmer go send letters to him  But you said, nope, face to face, stop there.  How do we get in front of them to have a conversation?  Is it just church coffee?  I mean, like what other tips and tricks  you got for our listeners that want to rent more ground?  I don't wanna step on Cori's toes,  but I kinda need to step on Cori's toes,  cause I need to expand my business.  Yeah, I mean, I think that, so let me,  let me take a step back.  If the letter is a, hey, I'd love to talk to you about this,  that's fine.  I think, but I would say if you can meet people through church, if you can grab somebody  toward the end of service, if you can go grab them for a coffee or you know they go to  a special bakery and you go and run into them there, that's face to face is going to be  much more impactful.  Farmer's daughter.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm born on this subject because letters to farmers and cold calling other farmers, landowners,  a lot of negative publicity.  So does that mean?  It does.  But at the same time, as once a young farmer,  probably still consider a young farmer,  but I've been farming for 10 years or more now,  how do you get your name out there?  Because you don't have time to go to coffee.  Your hustle, new and livestock, or off farm jobs,  or all this other stuff.  You should go to church.  But a lot of times you get young kids and all that.  That's a tough game.  How do you get in front of them?  Didn't we hear, and I got to think of how vaguely  to say this, because I know where we heard it from.  There is a young farmer that has put it in their budget  that wants a month.  They get a pizza, and they take it to a non-land,  non-current relationship.  Just show up.  Anybody can use a pizza.  If everybody eat in supper, that's fine.  They put it in the fridge or whatever.  They can use a celiacs.  But that was part of their item for a marketing budget.  Kwaz, I'm gonna take you pizza.  Most of the time they found out that they would sit there  and eat the pizza together to have that initial conversation.  Yeah.  How do I use?  Is it pepperoni or beef sausage?  I would turn it into cherry pie  just as a little plug for the cherry mystery.  How do we do the cherry land?  It's honestly, it goes exactly that.  So we are on a peninsula.  And my husband's whole operations are on a really small peninsula.  That's 18 miles long and a couple miles wide.  So the land out here is super limited.  And it is truly the relational piece.  And I understand that young farmers have families  and things are busy, but I would say that the relationship,  the time that my husband has been able to take,  because I think we would be considered young farmers too.  but the time he's been able to take to spend 15, 20 minutes,  talking to someone when they run into each other  at the gas station, pays massive dividends.  And I think we forget that.  We've gotten into this mode where we are all so busy  and so chaotic and so hectic,  but we all want to be part of a tribe.  If you think about our ancestors, we lived in tribes,  we lived as groups, we were protected in a tribe  and farmers were the core of that tribe,  because they provided the most important resource.  And we all want to feel like we are connected  to our community and farmers,  especially still have that connection.  And we don't wanna forget that connection  because that leads to the ability to  for a farmer who's retiring  or a farmer who's thinking about retiring,  to be willing to come to you  because you have had those interactions with them  And you are known as a young farmer who's trying to go grow to come to you and talk to you  about it.  Or you are the person who goes and takes cherry pie or pizza runs in a while to people.  But those connections.  You make me a logo for the hillaboe tribe.  Yeah.  Honestly, I mean, I can't you read about loneliness that people have.  And people want that connection.  And it means so much more today than it did in the past.  And so if you're the one willing to make that connection, it's going to pay dividends for  you maybe not this year or next year, but it absolutely will.  My ancestry comes back, Hillbone.  Well, for the sake of time, I just have one final question before we get some of your  contact information.  I also know that we have a huge fan of the podcast  that feels if you have a high quality pen  in an expensive watch that that provides you extra power  and negotiations is what?  Conversation started early in the board room, Tanner.  Oh.  Are there tools like that that matter?  I don't think so.  I think that there's this idea and negotiation  of homophily, which is I,  it's actually back to this tribe mentality  where I feel like I am actually a little bit  a part of your tribe.  You would probably,  the three of you would probably look at me  and never think that I would have anything  in common with you.  Let's be real, right?  Like we could walk past each other on the street  and you'd be like,  never in a second would you think  that we would have something in common  and that we'd be able to talk for an hour and a half?  But there's this idea of himothally  where you find something in common with someone  and you bridge the divide and that difference  And how do you bridge that?  And that connection is way more impactful  than them seeing a nice pen or a fancy watch.  So that's where I'm gonna challenge Tanner.  It's not about the fancy pen or the fancy watch.  It could be an old tractor.  It could be that you pulled in a Chevy truck  and they like Chevy trucks or whatever.  You just find commonality.  Yes.  And so I've literally had my mom's cat put down  while they were on vacation last week.  you know, RIP, Katniss.  And the vet had a Mont Blanc pen in his pocket.  And I've got a book on him and everything.  And I asked him about it.  We've talked for 30 minutes on how he went about,  like we have nothing else in common  besides he was putting down the cat.  And then he found out that his vet has 600 acres.  I wonder if we're on the net.  That didn't come up.  That didn't come up.  But so I would say, yeah, it's not about what it is.  It's just commonality in my opinion.  exactly could be college football.  It could be, I mean college football is such an easy one, right?  But it could be any, you know, a hobby or that pen  or, you know, a button that you have  or a cool fly fishing hat that you have.  Dave's gonna show up next time.  He's gonna have like a pin on his shirt  and a ball cap and a watch  and everything that you could potentially have  as a conversation starter just to see  what somebody picks up.  Yeah.  Now Dave, I want to know, can you spell, I'm awfully.  No, but I did write down because in my own letters,  I think it's great bridging the gap you said.  Yeah.  Anywhere's close.  It's H-O-M-O-P-H-I-L-Y.  Not what I would have done, but does it affirm?  I'm not gonna ever flock together.  Well, it's, I think Corey said it really well,  actually, commonality.  It's, what is that, what's that bridge?  What's the one thing you have in common  that you could chat with someone about?  I mean, I think if we have a true listener that went all the way through to the end of this episode  I want to know what is the strangest thing that you found in common with a landlord of yours  Send that in a text or an email, you know, I'm for profit LLC at gmail.com  I want to know is it cum la is it what's that really stinky fish ludafisk ludafisk?  bunch of Norwegians  Yeah, maybe something like that.  But, I'll tell you, this has been fantastic.  I'm glad that we found you.  It was a unique way listeners that we got connected to her.  And I hope this isn't the last time we get to chat.  If our listeners have a question or a scenario,  would you be okay if you provided some contact information  for them to potentially connect with you?  I would love that.  They can reach me through my website.  There's a contact form that'll come directly to me.  So it's just a Tia Kureshi.  uh, or a tear crashy dot com. And so they can just reach out through my contact form and be more  than happy to chat with anyone who has another question. I will put that in the show notes as well.  Guys, I know we've got more questions, but I think we just flat ran out of time today. So  really appreciate you joining us. Uh, this was a pleasure. I hope you had as much fun as we did.  I did. Thank you so much for having me. It was delightful. And I'm so, and I hope it's not the  the last time either. That's right, listeners, we appreciate you too. So until next time, have a good one.  Remember, if you aren't farming for profit, you won't be farming for long."

  "transcript": " In Zidero Sports, Icarus Canopies, now Gyro.  That's right, we've rebranded and Gyro is our next generation.  It honors our founder as that's a name we knew him by, but Gyro also marks the start of  a new chapter, and not to be biased, but it's going to be fucking epic.  Long story short, we're more us than ever, so if you're new to the sport, or even a  Skygodd Ninja Turtle, welcome.  I think our valiant leader Lucy, Jara's daughter, says it best.  And we still got that fuckie attitude.  Rebrand!  Woo!  Rebrand, woo indeed Lucy.  Anyway, hit over to Jara.com for more info and get amongst, Jill engines.  I was 19, broke, unemployed and sold my girlfriend's canopy for drug money.  So, I thought I'd better sew her in new one.  What a sentence and what a story.  This describes the humble yet outrageous beginnings of Enzi Aerosports, the home of Icarus  Canopies, in the words of our founder himself.  From getting a paratrooper toy from his mom, watching parachutes at the D.Z. as a six-year-old,  jumping off the war for the parachute made from bedsheets, doing his first jump at 16,  sewing his first canopy on a borrowed machine at 19, and starting to sell parachutes out  of a garage in 1986, Paul Giro Martin had an undying love for the sky.  Our company started with one man with a wildest of spirits and a true blue sky dream.  A renegade, in the time that Giro created and ran the Icarus canopies brand until he passed  away in 2017, he pushed everything he had to its limits.  We miss him and we always will.  Giro is the next generation of NZ Airau Sports.  It honors our founder of course because it was the name we all knew him by, but Jairo the  rebrand also marks the start of a new chapter.  Our next jump.  Jairo is the space between sound and silence, art and science.  Chaos and Calm.  Jairo is a state of epic tranquility that transcends understanding.  That moment in the door, in free fall, mid swoop, when nothing but the present exists.  a perfect balance of euphoria and thrill.  Gyro captures our passion for flying  and our commitment to designing  break the fucking rules, canopies,  that deliver pilots pure wild flight.  Hey gang, so I got a new book out.  It's called The Upside of Fear,  and it's exactly what you think it's about.  It's about the good side of, well, getting scared.  In it, we talk not only about the science  and biology behind fear, but the psychology as well.  And it's not just coming from me, it's coming from some of the best in the sport.  Omar Al-Hijalan, Jeff Provenzano, Maxine Tate, and so many more have contributed.  There sometimes terrifying stories to the book to help you overcome your fear.  So head to the lunaticfringepodcast.com.  You're gonna find the link to the book there as well as the other books.  It's available in e-book, paperback, hardback, and audiobook right now.  Come and stay from the cockpit. It's another episode of  What a dick friend, what the fuck am I?  Ready set go.  All right, in the can once again is the fucking pilot with another edition of lunatic fringe into the void  and boys and girls you're not gonna believe this one on on the other line the magic of Skype once again  I have well you tell me who am I talking to?  Hey, my name is Olaf Tibsa and  And I'm the guy who likes to fly the sky and I say, I'm swimming the ocean of gas.  I call it free flying.  Free flying.  Yeah.  It is.  Mr. Olav Zipser.  Olav, I am doing absolutely fantastic.  I'll tell you what, this is a real treat for me.  And for all the sky drivers of my generation, our generation,  because man, you've been kind of the name for a very, very long time.  I was watching the stuff that you were doing when I was just a little baby  guy ever and you're still doing it. You're still going hardcore man. I mean, it's amazing.  Well, I slowed down a little bit, but I'm still flying the sky 34 years later.  And yeah, I'm very happy that many people enjoy to fly the ocean of gases. I do.  At that time when I started, it was just belly flying and came from the swimming industry or not  industry but from the swimming sport as a kid. Also diving into the water from the  water from the tower thing and swimming the water scuba diving all this I learned as a kid.  When I was old enough to decide for myself 20 I decided to go diving.  How did that come about? Did you have family into skydiving or you just saw it somewhere?  how did you decide to make that first jump?  Oh, actually, it was very funny.  I almost did never jump.  I actually didn't want to jump.  I wanted to go hang riding on the Delta Flyhouse,  you know, the triangle thing.  Yeah, I had one friend who I helped once  to drive him up the mountain.  And then he flew down the mountain.  I drove him back up the mountain, kind of thing like that.  Wow.  And inspired me.  And I thought, like, man, that's a good thing.  I learned that too.  I already have a friend who can do this.  And I went to travel agency, but they didn't have any courses  available for the for the timing which I had vacation, you know, and they decided well, not  they decided they suggested go skydiving in Texas. You can do the AFF program. It's brand new in 1986.  It was a test program still. Sure. And I ended up doing skydiving. That was good, good thing for me.  So you went out to go make a hang glide for the first time and they just couldn't take the booking.  And that's the only reason you ended up becoming a skydiver.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's not what you expect from the father of reflying.  I mean, I would have.  I almost expected you to tell me that you've been dreaming of skydiving since you were  in diapers.  No, not really.  I mean, I saw the ramble movies and I got inspired by whatever, the war actually meant  that jump in, but it was never really in my mind to do things like this.  when I met this friend and I saw how he hanglights down the mountain, that's when I got inspired  you know to do something with aviation. So where's it? Where's it you did your first job?  In Texas, Texas is an island in Holland and it was in 1986. I think there was one of the few places  where the European people tried out the new American AF system to teach people. Wow, I was  I was lucky enough to enjoy that as one of the very first people.  So now you land from this first jump, did you know right then that that was for you?  I think so, yes, because I had it really easy in my mind.  The first three jumps were quite easy.  The first jump was a mental hurdle.  I almost was scared enough to not jump.  Really?  range not only have one junk master and I wasn't quite sure of what the whole thing is all about and  if it's worth it or something like this you know so I almost almost rejected but then I said  fuck it I'll do it anyway. You know that's really cool because I think a lot of people just assume  you know they they see someone like yourself or any of the the very visible sky covers in the sport  that have these tens of thousands of jumps and they assume that there's no fear involved  involved in their progression in the sport.  And it's always refreshing to hear someone, especially, you know, of your notoriety that says,  no, I was fucking scared.  I almost didn't do the jump.  So it's really cool to hear.  This is the truth.  Hey, I still get maybe not scared.  So much I get scared on a base jump.  I remember that.  That was intense.  But anyhow, it's healthy to be scared or not maybe scared, but at least concerned or safety  safety, safety cautious.  You know, gotta make in skydiving, I think, and suggest to everyone, it's like every day,  every jump, you make a new risk assessment calculation for yourself.  And only after that, you should allow yourself to either way, allow it or don't.  You know, make a decision at a time, you know?  Yeah, absolutely.  Not report or lazy about it.  There's no routine in this sport.  No, I think the fear is extremely healthy.  In fact, I had taken a pretty decent break from jumping.  Granted, I was flying in the sport the entire time, but I took about four years off and I didn't  start jumping again until someone suggested going out to make a jump in the idea actually scared me.  And I went, oh shit, I think it's time to jump again.  It's great.  It's a big deal to say.  And then you feel like, oh shit, man, that's really affecting me anyhow.  Yeah, no, it's amazing.  Well, so you make this first jump, you overcome that first hurdle of being scared.  How where does the sport really start for you?  Where where did it lead you to begin with?  Right after this, I think.  I told you I was almost scared enough not to jump, but that was actually probably my most famous jump ever.  Really?  Well, not for me because I don't really remember that much, but for my jump masters,  I thought from that point on their thought, I'm fucking with them because I did level four and level five and the level four jump and  Graduated me to level six and I never did anything like this  So as one of the first eight extra students was our talents ever right I did only six jumps for seven levels and I got  praise so highly and  people couldn't imagine it and  I bought the rig from my junk master  They sent me and hooked me up with people and throw it out so I could go to Zephyr Hills, throw it out.  Meet the best people in the world and that's what I did.  I cancelled my job and went to Florida and lived in the tent.  Wow, so you like right out of the gate man, you got out of AFF,  potteryg and moved to Florida.  Yeah, it took me maybe three weeks to cancel everything.  So the fucking shit that I had and fucking left it.  See now, that's the story I expect to hear about Olav Zipsir.  That's the story.  I got this here.  Somewhere, you know.  It was worth enough for me to try that.  I had a good job.  I was fixing teeth.  Dental technician can try that again.  So it's not like I left everything and decided never to come back.  Sure.  No.  I asked my boss for three months on paid vacation.  I don't know if Americans know what unpaid or what that means.  But in Germany, you have a working contract and you have only a certain amount of vacation  you and if you want to have more than you need permission for it or you don't get it.  Sure. And normally you don't get paid benefits or anything during that time but you get your job  back when you come back. That's pretty awesome. Yeah but my boss didn't agree to that.  He said I was crazy and then I just fired him and he said you can't fire me on your  I said, I don't care, man. I'll hire you anyhow.  I'm doing these weekends with the gay side.  I just go.  That's awesome.  So was Zephra Hill's Florida?  Was that the first place that you'd ever been  in the United States?  Yes, yes.  So straight to Florida to go jump out of airplanes for the  right off the bat.  And how was it?  I mean, was it everything you thought it was going to be?  It was, I far more than I ever imagined because I was,  I was a German boy from a bigger village that's basically it.  And now I come to Zephyr Hills.  So I actually, at that time, it was Phoenix Skydive Centre.  It was the Cabellas, they were running it.  They had DC3s, I believe.  It was the only place they had DC3s on the place.  And it was like, I would say, I was in the joyful time of ending up with the last of Woodstock.  And that was kind of the drops on.  the ludu wood. Oh man. Sometimes a hundred thousand people there was tents and trailers painted  like hippie, hippie times all around the airport. Little villages of trailer camps everywhere. Pink  flamingos everywhere was awesome. Wow. That had to be quite a culture shock for a little German boy  from a small village. Absolutely. But I quickly learned all the advantages of having such a life and  Yeah, clearly. I mean, well, how many years now have you been working? You did your first jump in you said 85?  86. So it's about 33 years now. Yeah, 33 years. Yeah, I'd say I'd say you've embraced the lifestyle.  I can't go back. I wouldn't know why. No, I mean, I could back and I still make some stuff  like art, you know, a lot work similar to what my previous job was all about, but  I like flying, I like teaching, I found a lot of people who give me joy when I teach them.  So, you're a first discipline obviously in skydiving at the time, belly flying was all that was going on really.  Correct. So, it was quickly, in Florida, people from the German team, Dietak Hirsch, maybe you know him, Kristoff Aunts, the Data Lewis Group.  As a young skydiver and so potential, I guess.  And they took me up in the four-way and eight-way team  in the German national team at that time.  And we started the...  Then we started the drop zone together, three of us.  Wow, there was a little...  Yeah.  There was a 1988.  And I was called skydive data loss.  That still exists.  And, yeah, and from that point on, I did AFF jumpmaster,  John Master and Tandon Master did all those things very quickly.  Okay.  Started working for up-somethings and team training and national team thing and competition.  But it wasn't my thing to fly on the belly.  I really had different things in my mind.  I wanted to swim through the ocean of gas, manipulate the air onto human body in such  a way that human free flight is possible and not just falls to the sky kind of.  So how did the idea or the desire for free flying first start?  I mean, where did you first start to think, you know, hey, if we can do this on our bellies,  we can turn this upside down.  How did that come to you?  It wasn't like this thing.  It wasn't like that.  It wasn't like I was going to invent something else.  I knew how to track everyone else.  I knew how to dive out of the DC suite when there's a sturdy way.  So you've got to go on your head.  There's nothing new.  All I did and had fun was flying two clouds in Florida.  There's lots of clouds.  They're very cute.  There's like, you know, they have like vertical edges sometimes.  And my private game, my personal fun was like,  can I possible jump out of the plane,  make it to the cloud, find my own rainbow  and fly that cloud edge down and see my shadow.  Right.  And doing that gaming and all that flying,  I just learn to fly all different angles  and speeds and stuff like that.  do your fucking Peter Pan. It wasn't about learning how to head down or how to do a looping  or something like this. It was about chasing the rainbow and because the rainbow is around  the shadow. And to get there quickly and still make it home and not have to walk through  the swamps, that's the game. It's a pretty good game. Alright, so you're doing this on your  own and you're basically chasing the clouds and playing Peter Pan and having a lot of  fun, but obviously from there to here, a whole lot of shit has happened. So I'm assuming  that you started getting friends coming out with you and this started to slowly morph  into what we now know as free-flying. Yeah?  Well, yeah. Kind of, yes, yes. I made some friends. We'll be a member. I was a young German  boy, 20 years old, couldn't speak much English. So it took some time to make some friends.  But I have to say, John, along from PD, you, everyone knows him.  He was one of my first friends.  He took me under his wings a little bit,  literally, because he gave me some of his early experimental parachutes.  I got to fly less than 100 square feet in maybe 88, 89 time.  How ridiculous.  So I made friends with him.  I met Scotty Cup that one.  Can you imagine what I saw about?  I met Tom Paris, Peter Goodnoir, and we did beautiful things.  But not like free-fly, but still kind of bellies.  When there were people together, it was like maybe going into tracking.  OK.  And then we had a game where we'd track next to each other and try to make a diamond formation  tracking, tracked out around the airport this time long.  Then we had a game.  I already knew how to go pretty fast and hold it and actually maneuver it.  It was not just a bullet dive, you know, down to a formation.  It was like what free fly is today, you sure.  Manugret back and forth and turn it like a, if level seven,  graduation thing, you know.  So whenever we put, whenever I put the tongue out,  next to someone in the tracking, that was the sign.  Well, that's cool.  It's awesome.  It was pretty limited.  It was actually crazy.  Could have done this better at that time already.  but no one thought of how to do it better.  Surely.  You know, that came over time of how to do it smoother,  train the people.  From that point on, I got more attention.  And here and there, I did some more AFF work  and train to people doing heavy of F already,  what my new words are and how I think about it.  Like, I don't like to say like jumping out of the plane  or exit.  I like to say to my students, we fly away  from the aircraft, we enter the air stream.  I used words like this.  Sure.  And yeah, more and more friends came together  and I made me have a job.  I didn't have to do it.  I have any more.  I did private, I don't know even what we call it.  Coach Dives.  Yeah, Coach, you just caught that in a different way.  Okay.  Coach Dives and load organizing with your friends, really.  So when did you know that something had changed? Like when did you look around and go wait a second?  Half of this plane isn't going to jump on their belly anymore. They're going to do some fun stuff.  Not that flying on your belly isn't fun. Don't kill me for everybody that loves belly flying. I think it's awesome.  But when did you know?  I know when when when I got to talk to people on the fire at that time in the late 80s.  Okay.  They did not understand of how I wanted to say things.  Sure.  Obviously also I didn't have the English vocabulary to say it in a proper way.  Sure.  But the imagine, nation and the reading in between the line, I understood the others don't  get it.  Right.  And that's understood.  It's really fucking difficult to explain them.  So that's where I came up with a new word.  I didn't call it free-fall.  I called it free-flying.  you know and free flying in itself is more like we fly away from the plane we enter the  s3 instead of an exit sure no it's a more imaginative word and I liked that and from that point on  I quoted free flying and not fun flying or anything well I'll tell you what do you you've got to have a  A real sense of pride in the fact that for someone like me who's a generation behind you,  although we're almost the same age, the word free-flying has been in my skydiving lexicon forever.  I mean, that's free-flying has been around as long as I've been in the sport and obviously much before.  And anybody and everybody that jumps now uses that as almost a second nature.  That's just part of skydiving. You gotta get a kick out of that, don't ya?  I'm very blessed. I think yes, I started a little fire and so care it doesn't go out and I gave a little spark to some other people who carry it to fire on and it's  it's it's it's like that now there's people don't go on the free flight campfire everywhere in the world and that's definitely makes me proud sometimes yes  Well, it's shit. You know, it's funny because I've actually mentioned you a number of times on the podcast and I always mention  one specific  section of one of the chronicles videos that I saw back when I was just starting out scot-having and  buddy of mine by the name of Jerry Fox had a trailer in the ghetto at Paris and  We had all piled in there after it  driving all the way from Las Vegas to jump all day and we're gonna jump the next day and  And we pop in his trailer and he lights up a blunt and everybody passes it around a little bit  and he pops in this tape called Chronicles and says you gotta watch this shit.  And I had never seen any of it before. Never seen free flying before at that time.  And the very first section of the video that came up was you to a sublime song and you were off in the distance on your head.  And you run to the cameraman upside down. You do two or three cartwheels, turn around and run away.  and I was fucking flocking, I was fucking florored.  Part of it may have been the weed.  Most of it was, oh my God, how the fuck did he do that?  And the very next day that we went out to jump,  I borrowed a big baggy jumpsuit from square one  and went out and of course flailed all over the sky,  but it was instantly because of that very first impression.  I was fucking blown away, as were so many people.  So it's I think you kind of undersell it.  You didn't start a fire.  You set off a fucking bomb.  Thank you.  Yeah, man.  No, no.  That's very nice.  I enjoy it.  You know, I have sometimes I when I think about it,  I think I have a couple more friends than I even know.  No, yeah.  Sometimes they're a person who really likes me  for whatever reason.  And I never even met them.  Enough funny cause of the videos to photos,  the inspiration, the beautiful guidelines,  which free fly and the first school of modern sky fly  was the space game.  Has kind of passed the stamp the way into what is  what could be nice, good flying.  For sure.  Now how did that start out?  Because I remember when you were coming up  with the ratings and you were using the,  what did you call it?  A space ball, the lead weight at tennis ball?  Yes, that was actually a necessity.  There was not a business trick or anything.  There was a necessity.  And if I may give you a little anecdote, basically,  I already have on my drop zone in Skydaw America,  I really have like say 10 people locals,  which fly really nice.  And we can start making 10 ways  and actually take the quips.  Okay.  Now we have 10 of us are barely good enough  to fucking try that.  You know?  So we're really happy.  We got our own playground and we are in Florida.  So now maybe one or two chronicles is already out at that time.  So free flight becomes more in the notice of the people, people try it like you do people, people teach themselves, you know.  So one day I believe someone from Texas, but let's not say text someone from somewhere else came and and he was cool.  body boy good good jump suit good week. I don't know looks perfectly normal free flyer at that time, you know and said like  Amen, I'm so cool. I'm come from there because of you guys can I jump with you and we were  Still very naive I guess there was not many people coming like this  We trained them ourselves  So we knew that people who we trained that were good church not not anyone came from outside and said like wow can do this shit  doing you know, can I come and jump with you? So we said yes and he jumps with us and  uh wow what a chaos man. I still remember that. What the fuck man I was worried.  Totally we do our thing and just do it.  You left and right everywhere. Total chaos then on the ground I ask him like kind of nicely  it's like hey man how was your job? He says it was awesome. It was so fantastic to see you guys  was just beautiful as all I wanted you know and then I said like yeah but did you not say you can do this  and he says yeah man I could do this really good I was see you all the time and I was there close  all the time and then I understood man the people think different things of what is good  no yeah that's not if someone just zooms around who no one knows and no one trusts and  he zooms around and does crazy shit in my idea because he can't even stop in his idea  because it's maybe more fun and stopping because you can't do it. And then he says and has the  attitude that was awesome and he should be, everyone should check his hand for like,  thanking him for being there, you know. And I go like, no man, that doesn't work like this.  Everyone here, really, really hard to fly really nice. That's why no one hurts each other  and scares each other, you know. This was bit on orderly. Why and why was this on orderly? He saw us  And then I said no, man, this doesn't work. Then I came up with this space board as a test  So I don't have to be the asshole telling people that they can't fly even if they think so, you know  I said for now on if you want to fly vertical in a certain  Formation then I made this ball which flies to  Exactly the same like our ten way at that time same speed and obviously straight down  And I made that as a test  I said to all my friends we all passed the test. So from now on that was the new standard.  If someone wants to come and join our group, fine. We don't need to believe you anymore.  You can now prove yourself, you know, who is this test? Sure. And if you cannot do it,  then obviously no one needs to say you can't fly because you know what you're saying.  Right, it'll answer its own question. So it took a lot of work and asshole behavior out of me  by telling people you can do it or you cannot come.  Right, which I mean at the end of the day,  you don't want to be the guy that has to shoot down somebody  that's just coming to play and have fun.  If they can understand themselves,  oh shit, I got to work a little bit before I can go do this,  then not only are they safe,  but you don't have to be the asshole.  Exactly.  It was ended up being a little business tool  because my school is very quite happy about this.  we were teaching someone towards a certain goal, which was a test.  And then in the end, we had an independent measuring stick in the sky,  the space all which we then test them on individually,  but the same idea to everyone all around the world in all seven schools at that time.  Sure. And that made a world standard and gave people a goal to work towards to.  Sure. Because if I said at that time,  If you can fly like this and pass this test and I say to everyone that dude is not so bad.  If he passes to be test and I would say to everyone that dude is actually fucking bad ass, you know, sure.  And people wanted to have that endorsement and people wanted to be part of the space games where we did the cool races with the only 500 around the pilots.  the AD challenge where people had to race in certain rotational sequences next to the space board and  Obviously you were only only allowed to be part of those  Sponsored and price-money space games when you actually tested yourself before and had the qualifications to to be even  participate sure now  And I mean, the free flying brought up a whole bunch of safety issues that weren't there  before just because of the speed involved.  So I mean, it was a necessity for you to come up with this way to assess people because  it can be downright dangerous with someone that's flying like an ass clown.  Absolutely.  And the dude I just told the story about, you know, he was just the first.  People came the next week and the next week and the next month and then they came more  more and more because, well, it got more and more popular, you know, particular, through the space  games. I believe we're almost every month of magazine printing in some country. We had a couple  of pages because of the space games. Of course. Oh, it was fucking revolutionary. I mean, when I would  get my issue of parachutists, I would, you know, you'd read the incident reports if you, if they  were there to learn lessons and everything, but then you just flip through the pictures to find  somebody that was vertical. All right, what cool shit are they doing? And it was it was no snub  against the four-way stuff or the eight-way stuff or any of that or the big ways. It was just that it  was so different and so new looking and so almost alien that you were just attracted to it. Like,  holy shit. Look what they did this time. I totally agree. You know, and I did get a little  shit of it and I did make a little fun of the belly fliers, you know, things like that. Sure.  The people I didn't start the belly flanges because they wanted to make fun of the accuracy guys  They're on fun. They wanted to do having fun their own way and then the accuracy skies  They probably said also of f**k you belly fliers, you know, you you special people  Sure, you bet well, I think everybody still kind of makes fun of the accuracy guys  There's the drain with the good neck jafries and and stuff and then Thomas training them still you know  or ESP that was actually.  And then we made jokes about each other.  Because free flight was still new.  Did no one really knew kind of.  You know, the old thought it was a phase.  Sure.  And I say like, are you guys still training  the student body position?  Well, I remember seeing a video that you did  one really cool jump where you were in a super baggy suit,  almost like one of the old flyaway tunnel suits.  And you were free flying around,  I believe it was an eight way belly.  and you'd go up through the center and then roll over onto your head and then dive back down  and be at a sit flying carve around them.  And it was just this beautiful kind of mixing.  And that's the beautiful movie which Patrick pass and Wendy Smith made.  Yeah.  It's called Crosswind.  It has a super collect of all kinds of different beautiful flying in the beginning of the 2000s.  Sort of.  Yeah.  And it was fucking gorgeous because it was this beautiful mixing of the two disciplines.  I mean it just it showcased the dynamic ability of free flying and the stability of belly  flying and it was really super cool.  I think it's one of the most photogenic pieces I ever was allowed to be part of.  You know it was all the smoke and the cool people flying there and also some baseball  tricks and dancing with Stefania.  Oh man, that one.  That one you know it was kind of funny because that video I wasn't even paying  attention to the video at the moment. I don't remember it was being showed with a large group of people  and I only caught the beginning of the first jump out of the corner of my eye and I looked over  and instantly knew I'm like holy shit there ballroom dancing.  Hey, yeah, that's what fucking was it was? Yeah, I was blown away because it came through perfectly  100% and I'm like he's ball how the fuck is he ballroom dancing on his head? And this is at the  time when I'm still working just to stay on my head and you're ballroom dancing. What the fuck?  Hey, in the end, it's the only trick is one needs to manipulate immediate air around a human  body in such a way that flight is possible.  Sure.  It does nothing but do.  Every belly flyer does it.  Sure.  You know, even an unconscious person manipulates the air around himself, but just not  consciously sure.  So even that fucker is free flyer.  I don't know.  The other way he wants to go, right?  the trick. Look ahead like driving a motorcycle, see your curve in advance, intercept,  make interception timing kind of curves with the others. So you know where to go to meet them at a  certain time. It is badass. I think free fly took the stalling out of falling. There's no way  you can stall as a accomplished free-fire.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a little bit related to air around you in such a way that you can have control of it.  You learn to fly in any orientation, absolutely.  Now, it's kind of funny because it seems like your mentality is a mix of what I would think of as a very  strict German technical and very hippie all at the same time.  So you've got it.  It would mean to each other very nice.  Yes. I do. I did write down all those procedures  how to train the student, how to train the teacher, how to  train the teacher, how to make a competition, how to  train the judges for the competition. And then I put a  lot of work into all the different schools in Argentina,  Brazilian, Venezuela, North America, all over Europe,  Asia, Australia, applying or at least suggesting those new ideas to the  AeroClaps. Sure. They all start making their own little teams and that's why we  have a world championship. Yeah, absolutely. Well, in that part of it, very much  seems very, very German and regimented. And then the watching you fly though  seems very hippie. And by that, I mean, just very free. I mean, as the only word  to put it, it doesn't seem calculated.  It seems very free and very relaxed and very easy.  And that's one of the things that I was always impressed with  coming up in the sport with the really talented free flyers  is watching.  It just seemed effortless.  I believe that, you know, what is the goal on making a sport?  On running for example, it's to be energy-conservative, you know?  What's goal on a sprinting sport is to pump it out in a short amount of time.  So you must do both at all time, even if you go full power, like the sprinting sport in the sky, that's the sprinting sport.  And that direction is, I think that's why also some free flight techniques in the modern tunnel.  There are different than the original free flight techniques in the sky.  because in the tunnel you have an endurance sport. People want to fly half an hour an hour.  You can't do that with original free flight techniques. Sure.  You would out too much energy for you couldn't you couldn't do it. Sure.  So tunnel tunnel techniques are not necessarily better flying techniques,  but they are better flying long lasting technique. Sure.  a marathon runner, you know. He wouldn't run full power right away either. You couldn't do it.  And if you would be a sprint, I wouldn't run like a marathon runner. You wouldn't ever win.  Right. Two different leagues, even if you do the same fucking thing, you'll run from here to there.  Sure. So, and when did the competition stuff start to come into play with free flying?  Because I remember in the beginning it was it was the competition side of things was kind of slow  to start wasn't it? Yeah well first it was Pete McKim and with the SSI  pro tour which took over freestyle and sky surfing and pitched up to the ESPN  network and that was in 91 in Vero Beach that was the first official  competition for that. I was invited on that it didn't get a medal but showed my  free fly stuff, my head down stuff and that was they said there was unique  there never seen anything like this before so from that point on the year  after I had my own team which was Michael Mike Mike Vail, myself we were  at the free fly clowns you had a year to play and we rocked it after that  Mike Vail was that as student you know picked him up after AFF and even packed  for him just because I was so inspired to finally find someone to hang out with and  and teach him flying really cool. Really? He had money, he had money, he was a hippie and he wanted to.  Yeah, I mean he was another one of those characters that you'd see in some of these videos flying  around with these massive dreadlocks and of course the clown masks and stuff and it just was,  it just looked like so much fucking fun. It just looked like there was nothing that wasn't amazing  about it. It was, we had good music at the time, all this crunchy music, supply and rights.  It was a very badass young man time for me.  Yeah, well you know it's funny because if you talk to a lot of the skydivers of our generation,  most of them, if you ask them what kind of music, reminds them the most of some of their  favorite times in skydiving, sublime is like the number one band. And I can tell you right now  For me, it's specifically because of how much you guys used it in the Chronicles videos.  You guys, you guys, it's been that man.  Yeah, super dear, was those guys' charts, was used to be a musician.  He knew them somehow.  At the time when they were even famous.  And I think to supply them with the Chronicles,  it was the first time that in Europe people said that they even heard supply them.  Was on our Chronicles.  Yeah, man.  Imagine.  So that's fucking, that's epic.  Yeah, I don't know if that's really really true, but I hear that a few times  So for sure they were in the beginning of their career the sharing people so now when did the big free flying competitions start when when did it really kick off crazy like that?  I think my most important free flight competition which I would have not  Like to not win was in Spain 2001 was the first world championship the first world air games where free flight was included  And for me, that was a big milestone as it was to cherry on my cake or free fly creation  sort of.  You know, finally, there's a world championship.  So I want to I want to do in it.  And we did win it as the Americans.  I was an erased and American flag was this work.  Nelson.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Swanson.  We were the team.  Nelson, Mike Swanson and Olav Zips are in 2001. That's fucking cool. Now it's kind of funny  because I tell you that I was introduced to you and you know getting stoned in a trailer  in Paris Valley watching chronicles. But in 1998 you competed in the US Nationals in  Elsinore. Do you remember what what discipline you were were competing in?  I think you're mistaken. It was not out to know it was Paris Valley. Oh, Paris Valley was  the one you were in. Well, I think you must have been at the 98 nationals then in  Elson or because Omar was competing in what was it, a freestyle in 98 and I was competing  in Skysurfing and that's actually the very first time I ever met you was in the 98 nationals.  Are you sure was Elson or not, Paris Valley? Yeah, positive because we were all sitting on  the grass getting ready to do jumps and maybe you had just hopped over for the day because  the nationals were going on. It's very possible.  but if it was asked to stay, I would have probably competed because I was an American competitor, you know?  Yeah, it was it was it was 98. 98 at Elsonar for sure. I'm actually sitting here with the second place medal  I got with my my Skysurfer. Congratulations. Yeah. Well, they're there were only two there were only two teams, but don't tell anybody.  I don't know if you're happy.  I can't do metals like this.  I only competed otherwise they would have had  not a competition.  Yeah.  Actually, it was funny because my Skyster partner and I were just going to do the open  or not the open, but just the intermediate.  And there were no teams in intermediate.  And there was only one other team in the open.  And that was Craig and Tonya Garcia.  Yeah, they knew what they were doing.  Yeah.  And so they asked us if we wanted to compete in the intermediate.  and we're like, no, fuck no, I'd rather get my ass kicked by Tanya than when a gold by myself.  So we went and Craig and Tonya kicked our asses.  So 2001, you win the world and you actually ended up competing in Skysurfing at one point, didn't you?  Yes, I am. As I traveled and went to oil competitions mostly for free start or free fly later on.  you know I always sort of like,  man, let's do the other competition too.  You were allowed to compete two times.  Sure.  So I did just for fun.  You know, I will never win it a good thing.  But I also did, I was a skyser,  as a skyser for myself,  I never really won much for nothing actually.  But as a competitor,  as a skyser of cameraman with Eric of Pade,  or Sean McConaug, or even Gaudencia Martinengo,  we made metals at the world, meets and also metals at the X Games.  Sure. Well, that was actually, I think you were the first person I ever saw,  um, um, do camera flying for a Skysurfer without wings.  Yeah, there was a 95 with Gaudencia and, uh, that was awesome.  I got an Emmy for this kind of flying over there.  Yeah, and it was impressive as fucking hell. I mean, it was, um, just mind bending at the  time because of course the best of the best needed those wings for the dramatic  speed changes in Skysurfing and here you are in a baggy free-fly suit just banging  it out in the most unique way and it was fucking fantastic. That reminds me of  the I think it was the parachuteish cover shot of you free-fly and holding your  Emmy. Yeah, I don't know there's been often there's a few Emmy shots  was me often. That's bad. So, Wiscau Densia, that was a really fun team. She was the  sister of my girlfriend and she was awesome. She was one of what she was the best.  With Rydi and Descartes, you know, they were the best guys of us at the time.  And was a proud iron for awesome first extreme gains with super, super event.  Super cool. It was kind of funny because I had Andrew Ford 40 on here a while back and he told me  that he was actually in a competition where you were sky surfing and the funny story that he told  was that you had put your release handle for the board was on I guess on your hip where it was  supposed to be and you'd stood up and the cables were too short so it was releasing the bindings.  So you just unsit the fly on the jeans that you were wearing and stuck the release hand  out of your fly.  Which is fucking awesome man.  That is awesome.  Hey, you got to do what you got to do.  You got to do what you got to do.  Right.  Man, that's fucking epic.  So you go through all this competition and stuff and then free flying is now taken off.  It's a full blown hardcore sport.  And then here come the tunnels and they turn the whole scativing world on its head.  And I don't know that anybody saw that coming because I worked at the old Las Vegas tunnel  where you know, you could barely manage to do kind of a tracking carve in the tunnel because  the wind was so slow.  But I was in instructor there back back in a day day and it's still going strong.  But these modern tunnels man, what's your opinion of them?  I think Skydiving is it's gonna die slowly. It's a pessimistic idea. It's gonna die slowly.  But yes, space is gonna get more crowded, a few more expensive, flah-lah, the risk factor will be  calculated differently. Plus, it's so much more easy to spend all your money. In a ton of these days,  if you would only drive 20 minutes down your city block and you find a tunnel in every big town now.  Yeah, so it's super convenient for for people who like to  Learn to fly. Yes. It's a fantastic new revolution. Yeah sad for skydiving. I believe but good for for people good for the news sport of  Channel flying yes, yeah tunnel flying. I definitely I think it is a completely different sport  I mean obviously you're still flying but it's it's a whole new world for sure  I don't know that I think it's the death of skydiving, but I certainly think that it's gonna confine skydiving too  more destination drop zones. I don't think there's going to be so many  drops on scattered around. I totally agree. And plus all the  imagine all this calculation. I mean like how many tunnels out there? I say  300 which you agree. Oh, if not more. Okay, that's just 300 300 times let's say  4 million. That's fucking what? 1.2 billion dollars. Yeah.  They just construct cost. That's missing in the skydiving industry. Not only  this order money which people pump into it. That's maybe a three, four billion dollar industry  which they have created and all that money is missing in skydiving in some way.  Yeah, no, I agree. Well, and I think the other factor that plays a part with the general public  anyway is the danger factor. They think you're only going to get bumps and bruises if that in a  wind tunnel and everybody thinks that's kind of a new dangerous, which it is. I mean, obviously,  there's more risk involved when you start throwing thousands of feet and nylon and string into  the mix. But yeah, I completely agree with you. I think that the tunnel industry has definitely  taken a lot from the skydiving industry in that respect for sure.  It's a complete disruptor. Disrupting ideas are always good. Freefly was a little bit of a  with this raptor and itself.  Sure.  It's just evolution.  I congratulate everyone who went early into this business  and probably made it quite healthy.  Oh, yeah.  This business, yeah.  So now we speak in a very long time.  But 100 not only had the beauty of nature.  I think to say very strong, I would say,  to swim, to learn to swim in the ocean of gas,  you need to have air around you or water around you.  without water you can't learn to swim, right?  You can learn to swim in the bathtub,  in a swimming pool or in the ocean.  So there's the difference in a bathtub  in swimming pool you will have zero risk  or very little risk.  It's very controlled environment.  You have no waves, you have no fishes, no sharks,  no coral reef, no shit.  Sure.  Oh, but yes, you can learn to swim  and swim really beautiful.  Why not?  Everyone can have fun swimming,  but I like to have fun swimming while flying next to the clouds,  chasing rainbows.  So little cars driving on the freeway,  seeing the boats going to the island,  see the coral reefs and the colors around it, you know?  Oh, absolutely.  And that is something which in a tunnel,  maybe one day was augmented reality and shit.  Maybe you can do it better there,  but I enjoy the beauty of the nature.  Yeah, I heard a comment once that I thought  was pretty apt. It said, nobody stayed on the treadmill in extra 20 minutes to see what was  over the next hill. You know, I've never been sitting waiting for my turn in the tunnel  and had to take my phone out to take a picture of the amazing clouds I was flying by.  So you're right, there is no way to simulate, at least not now, no way to really get that  type of feeling out of it. And that experience in skydiving, because that's unique to  this board. I mean, you know, and you're  eekness makes it worth it. I believe. Oh, yeah. I mean, when the  hell else do you get to hop in some plane and after you're above  a thousand feet open the door and dangle your feet out the back  of the plane and just watch the world fly by. I mean, come  on. I've never considered myself anything, but lucky that I  get to experience that kind of stuff. Absolutely. Now, I  I think like 24,000 jumps or something like it.  Now I've had the opportunity to sit a lot of time next  to the door being like sort of the Lord master or something.  Wow, my favorite time on planet earth is sitting in that door  and just fucking glaze out and let the door plan  and go past me.  Oh yeah, I mean, it's the same as the same as the same.  It's the same as the same.  It's green chair ever.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, it's the same for me sitting up front  when I'm flying the plane and I've got a minute  to just kind of look around.  And I can't count how many thousands of photos  I've got on my phone because I just had to get a picture  of this sunset or that cloud or this view of the same piece  of ground I've been flying over for God knows how long  but I gotta have another picture of it  because it's just a damn beautiful.  I mean, I don't know.  There you go.  Yeah, and I don't know anybody sitting in an office  that holy shit, I gotta get another picture  of the coffee machine.  We are blessed by our own space time design.  Now, a speaking of shaken things up, you have had a long time desire to try and blast yourself  into outer space and make a jump from space.  I did.  I started with high altitude jumps early times in the 90s and skydive Davis.  They had a king here which went really high.  I did some little military jumps kind of in Germany.  Then I got a super duper opportunity with Patrick the Guaya Dong.  1995 just after Russia was finished being Soviet Union.  We went over there with a little budget and we rented an illusion 76 and shot ourselves up to 47,000 feet.  Made our own little spacesuits and was fucking crazy mission.  but it was awesome. And it inspired me to do that all one day better with less risk and more scientific  benefits from after doing such a stunt or research mission. Sure. And since then,  I think it was like 99 or 2000 when I got again more interested in this. And I researched some of the  private rocket companies which like SpaceX was not even existing at that time but there were some private rocket companies like  a modeler, aerospace, inter-orbital system, X-core, other little ones and I put a lot of effort into it to get some good connections and get to  to get the permission to visit those rocket companies  because I wanted to get myself a rocket and do,  I still wanted to build a better space to it.  So people can buy out two jumps and maybe come back  from space one day as a biomechanical flex wing.  Well, hadn't they looked into an egress system  for the astronauts?  And that was one of the thoughts was that they would be able  use basically a bailout and parachute system to be able to do exactly that.  Yeah, on ascent? Yes. Yeah, that was the escape. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what?  All the astronauts technicians or space engineers which I have the opportunity to talk to in  Russia or America, they have never really considered one thing that the human people can fly  I'm self.  We, or I particularly, I truly believe I can manipulate the  around my human body that I can fly, stay in control.  Yeah, when that is possible in the low atmospheric  pressures or with high speed, even in high atmospheric  pressures, higher altitudes, then one can do such things.  And there are other opportunities which we developed  in how we can keep control even at higher altitudes,  where there's no atmospheric pressure to fly with.  People in everyone who, all the spacesuits,  which I tested, all the engineers,  which I ask and interviewed,  they never considered those kind of opportunities  that you actually can see or something from the inside out.  Sure.  And that is of the big factors,  which we believe makes it feasible to even attempt  such research missions in finding  that makes a benefit and can be implemented into a future space suit,  in space emergency rescue solution.  Wow.  Well, you know, it's kind of, I've stopped thinking things aren't possible anymore.  Now I just kind of assumed that eventually everything's going to happen,  because every time I think there's no way somebody can do that,  somebody goes out and does whatever it is I think they can't do.  It just becomes more and more amazing.  And it's super cool, especially in a sport as young as skydiving,  to see the crazy growth in the abilities of just the average skydiver from the lowly AFF student  all the way up to someone like yourself. It's just amazing what a short small period of time our  sports been around and how much it's grown. Yeah I think modern or new or different modified  teaching techniques are the key for faster development. The way we teach these days, the way I teach  someone is different and let's say one of these traditional military teaching programs.  Definitely different. Sure. And the way we teach is this beauty and harmony and fantastic  control by saying like we fly away we don't fucking exit something you know we don't  plummet somewhere and then try to get control no we fly away with control right away  and we manipulate it here we're not just pushing ourselves on any air cushion or I don't know  in now in the moment of what the differences are in the way you can with different pet  and go get kind of take the fear out of future students.  Sure.  Well, and that's the thing too, is the more you give them the knowledge and the techniques,  the less that part of the fear is there because that unknown is taken away.  There's always going to be that little bit of fear in there should be because like we talked  in the beginning of the podcast, that fear is what keeps you sharp.  It's what keeps you safe.  That alertness should never be gone.  should be there forever, but being able to take the fear of flying out of the equation is amazing.  Yeah, I believe people are like, what's this or something? You know, we have a certain sense,  which if I put myself under the wings of someone else and expect him to keep me safe and teach  me something, I kind of probe him for all his emotions. If I see that that person is nervous,  then I get nervous too as a student, you know. If you are a writer or a horse and you don't know  what to do, the horse will know exactly that you fucking suck in writing and don't know how to do.  So I think all students feel this unconsciously from their teachers also. So if you have a teacher  who can't free fly and is worried doing if, if that maybe your student is falling on the back  and they can't get them, then that fear is to telepathically somehow transmitted to possibly  the student as well. Sure. And yeah, I think a better educated teacher with a more self-confidence  can possibly be also a better pedagogy for teaching people in the sky.  Oh, I completely agree. I mean, the more well-rounded you are as an instructor,  or even if you're not teaching all the disciplines  that you know, the better you're gonna be able  to impart that information to someone else for sure.  So what is Olav's upset to these days?  Where have you been jumping lately?  Well, I've been traveling since I met you last in Dubai.  Remember, I was definitely,  this is already years ago,  or three and a half years ago.  I had a beautiful opportunity to work  with the sports government in Botswana.  My job was to investigate the country for a year and find airplanes to travel spots,  places to land, did some demos here on the earth, did tandem.  And basically the idea was to investigate if it's feasible to make a sports center for  skydiving in Botswana.  OK.  That was a beautiful job.  I had a lot of animals.  lot of animals had a little, even for myself a girlfriend there.  But research girl was awesome.  spent a lot of time in the bush with all the wild animals  and jumped out of medical helicopters,  took some cool people and landed them places.  That's awesome.  Yeah, that didn't work out after one year.  The contract did not get in green youth and some problems  in the local government.  Someone died also.  I was a new governor on place no one knew nothing about nursing us any how big chaos and it was too difficult for me  Then I spent a year in Namibia traveling there jumping all over there  Then I spent some time in South Africa also looking for maybe a new opportunity to create a new center  And that's exactly what I'm doing now in Thailand nice  Since a year and a half now in Thailand and I really love it there  It's a beautiful spot.  After Venezuela and Africa, a question kind of in the lifestyle, in the politics and the  behaviour of the people, I think Thailand is a blessed country by beauty and harmony and  just a soft lifestyle.  I'm not really foxblows.  It's beautiful.  And it's, I mean, you've been doing this for a very long time.  So the, the high stress and, and, uh, fuss and in fighting to get stuff done can't be appealing.  It certainly isn't to me.  No, getting visas, working permits, uh, you know, resident visas and shit like this.  That's the probably the biggest hurdle in my life, which I have to overcome every couple  years because I decide to, uh, have more adventures in another country and, and do what  I can do it. I'll find new places, teach new people and have fun.  Which is amazing. So as we start wrapping things up, what advice do you give to a few different  groups? What advice do you give to newer jumpers just finding their way in the sport? And  what advice do you give to jumpers that maybe think and shit there's nothing new? I don't  know if I'm going to keep this up anymore.  Wow. What aggressive? What advice I would give to everyone is like, um,  Keep it fresh all the time.  Don't always do the same thing.  Think before you fly and try to design something in your third eye.  Close your eyes.  Imagine it.  If you can imagine it in your eyes, in your eyes,  and feel your muscles while you imagine yourself doing a new flying maneuver with your friends or something,  then you probably have a good chance to actually do it in the sky.  if you can imagine it. If you can't imagine it, then maybe not be so open in trying new things right  away all the time. Because it's probably very difficult to just do something in the sky. If you can't  even imagine of what you're supposed to do before, you know? And I see, yeah, well, maybe it sounds  a bit negative, but I see people jumping into two difficult flying techniques with other friends  to early. Sure. And that bothers me a little bit because I really tried to work on not putting rules  on things but putting safety guidelines, you know, ideas, inspiration of what should someone  think before he thinks he's good and then try to mess with 20 other people in the sky. Sure.  Sure. Well, I kind of lay social media to a little bit of blame for people kind of getting ahead  of themselves with stuff like that because they're able to see things nowadays that when  we were starting out in the late 90s, you didn't get to see the free flying stuff unless  somebody had a bootleg copy of Chronicles.  And you know, or maybe you got to watch somebody that kind of knew how to free fly because  they happened to put their video up in the bar.  And that's the only way you got to see any of it.  Now all you have to do is write skydiving or free flying and put it on YouTube and you've  got millions of videos of badass people and a whole bunch of bad ideas for somebody that  doesn't know what they're doing.  Totally agree.  Hey, but what can we do, you know?  I think it's the full of people I inspired and what they do with the inspiration is obviously  up to the individual of how to decide if they're on a, which way they want to proceed, you  Yeah, for sure.  I mean, anything can be a weapon or used for something good, you know?  Well, I suppose it's better to have inspiration that might be out of reach a little bit at  that time that to have no inspiration at all, right?  I totally agree.  Imagination is more important than knowledge.  You can always imagine something new.  Oh yeah.  But if you just have a certain knowledge, then you fucking stocked with that shit.  I couldn't agree more.  I could not agree more.  Well, you know, it's funny because again, I like I told you my first introduction to Olav's  Epsir and to the free fly clowns and to free flying at all was that worn out tape in that  little trailer in Paris Valley.  So to be able to, and it's funny to use the word hero, but that's a good word to use because  I didn't know you back then.  And you absolutely were somebody that I looked up to and  aspired to do the things that you were doing.  And even though you're only just a few years older than me,  it was always this almost irreverence for what you were able to do.  And then having met you only briefly way back then I still held onto that because I didn't know you.  And then of course I got this finally sit down and talk to you 20 some odd years later over the course of our time working in the same facilities.  And when, all right, on top of everything, he's fucking cool.  Shit.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  I try.  I try.  I like everyone should be crying.  Not to be cool, but just be yourself.  And then other people can tell you who you are.  Absolutely.  You just, people can just do what they do.  If people want to change themself  and pretend certain things in this really tough to judge them.  Agreed.  I completely agree.  the people you are bring what you can bring and have the happy vibes and suck them all  from other people so you can give them on to other people.  Damn right.  Damn right.  Well, all I'll tell you what man, I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to sit down  and I have this chat with me and I know there's a lot of people that are going to really  enjoy hearing what you've got to say.  Oh man.  Thank you very much Dean for this opportunity.  I wish all you guys who ever hear this, please all free fly your mind.  you know, think about things, space time design your life, you know?  And I hope to speak to you one day again.  Oh, you know we will man, it's a small world and a smaller sport.  I can't thank you enough.  Okay, all the best and hello, hello, hello.

  "transcript": " Welcome to Photoact with Bob Namp, the Bat Photography and Technology.  I'm Kirk McElle and I'm Jim curls.  You can find show notes including any photos we discussed in this episode of photoactive.co  that's photoactive.co.  So we have a non-technical topic today.  And if I can propose a title for the episode, it would be process and product.  Because we're going to talk about photography in the sense that it doesn't matter how  your photos end up? Wait, that's what? That the results are less important than the journey.  So that the product is less important than the process. And this is inspired by an article  that showed up in Apple News from the other day. The joy of taking pictures no one else  will ever see. Stop feeding the algorithm. It was from digital camera world. We'll put a link  in the show notes. And it made me think that go back 15 years. The only people who ever  saw your photos were your close friends and family or if you had a bunch of people around  to show photos of a vacation. Or your son or daughter brings home a potential significant  other when you get out the album of baby photos. Or, you know, that kind of thing. People  didn't really look at photos that much. I mean, okay, if you had a wedding, you've got  a photo album and you might look at that and show people. But there wasn't this, the  world had not become a world of exhibitionists and exhibitionists in the sense of people  who put themselves on TikTok to show themselves doing dumb things or to show how good  looking there, they are, or to show them on top of, or in front of some landmark where  you can't see the whole line of people waiting to get the same photo, that sort of thing.  It photos were a, they were very personal in the past and all that's changed.  Yeah.  Well, and I think you said 15 years and we probably need to back that up another 10 before  that.  Well, I'm thinking before social media, although, okay, yeah, before social media.  This book came around in 2004, I believe, for the general public.  So that's when people started posting photos online like that.  Some of the people may have posted photos on a website, but it wasn't a common thing  and maybe a professional photographer had a portfolio.  But people didn't share photos the way they did once Facebook and Instagram came around.  So let's say 20 years.  Yeah, okay.  That sounds more likely.  I mean, I'm thinking of Flickr as being one of the very first, you know, photo sharing  sites, but mostly that too was photographers who were sharing things. So I went out and took photos  and I'm going to put them up here rather than what we see now, which is, look, here are just  everyday things that I saw. This is the cup of coffee that I had. This is the place that I've been,  like that kind of thing. So Flickr was created in 2004 as well.  So that's really an inflection point that year.  Yeah.  And by the way, I actually did share a photo of a coffee that I had this week.  So I'm not going to try to make a sound like I'm above all of this.  In fact, I mean, actually the opposite because what this article inspired me to think  about was just that idea of taking pictures for the sake of taking pictures because I  still look at Instagram and I think that's because there are some people that I follow there,  some accounts that I appreciate, but it's so much more work now and it doesn't feel like it's not fun.  There's so much that is ads, there's so much that is engagement bait, which is also like one of the  reason why I really like glass. Like I still pay for glass and we've talked to the people  from glass a few times on this podcast because that is very much more photographers who are  sharing their work. That also never is different. But if never the less glass is a fire hose,  right? You look at your feet, it's picture after picture after picture after picture.  And while they're nicer pictures and there's no algorithm, you only see people you follow. I mean,  I mean, you can look at a more general feed  to define new photographers to follow.  It's still a fire hose that prevents you  from taking time to look at a picture.  Oh, hang on a second.  I don't think it prevents you from taking time  to look at a picture.  It just gives you a better selection of pictures.  But you still want to look at the next one.  You can stop, but you want to look at the next one  because we've been trained to do that.  Look, I can stop anytime.  This social media does not control me.  Hang on a second.  I got to go check my feed.  Yeah.  Because I'm looking at my feed now, and I'm  going to show you it's got three photos.  That are all a, look like a 4.3 and a 3.2 aspect ratio.  So it's your three photos on my iPhone 16 Pro Max.  So it's on a large display.  And when I'm looking at one, I see two others.  So I can tap one to isolate it.  But the feed itself is still, okay, here's a nice photo, but look at the one below it.  That sort of thing.  In fact, if you're listening Tom and Stefan, maybe the feed should be an option  for the feed is just like a single photo.  But like when you're looking at TikTok, you see one video and you swipe and it's  which is to another one.  Maybe the glass feed could have an option to just have one photo and you swipe  to see the next one instead of this sort of endless scrolling fire hose feed.  I love that idea.  What's interesting is I never thought of that because we're so used to having the scroll,  the endless role for so many different things.  So this brings up another thing and I don't like using the H word, right?  There are certain words.  No hobby.  I don't like using the word hobby.  Photography is a hobby because to me hobby has these negative connotations of women doing needle  point, men making replicas of the Notre Dame cathedral out of matchsticks, you know,  that kind of thing, or something past time to pass your time that you're doing just to  fill your time.  And that's not what it is.  This is a passion project to take photographs and to work with them and to edit them, etc.  So I don't like the H word for anything like that.  People discover this because I think that's the way I think that's the way I think  Think what's important is this is a way of expressing creativity.  When you first get a camera, I mean, okay, forget about smartphones where everyone has  a camera, but back in the day when you got a camera, you had to figure out how to use it,  right?  You knew when you took a bad picture.  When you pointed at something and you got the picture back and it was dumb and you slowly  learned how to make pictures that were more interesting.  And that's part of the creative process of that, of learning how to make interesting pictures,  which can be quicker with a smartphone because you can take as many pictures as you  want, you don't have to pay for development, etc.  The creative process unlocks something in our brains that is pleasing.  It's a different kind of dopamine.  It's not the dopamine you get from scrolling.  It's a dopamine of satisfaction that you've done something that is nice.  The question is does everyone need to see it?  Because what you'll find is that most people who see it don't think it's very nice.  Then you're going to think you're a crap photographer.  Whereas if you just take your pictures and look at them and think, I like this picture.  Yeah.  I actually want to get back to the dopamine a little bit later because I think that's  a really interesting point.  Maybe now because I just brought it up.  Just in that sense of the other thing that happens, and again, I'm guilty of this too,  is you go out, you take a picture of something, maybe you caught a nice sunset.  This could be on a phone, on a regular camera, whatever.  And you post that to social media.  And you get people who are friends and family, or maybe others,  who think, wow, that is a really great shot.  And I know deep inside, it is not a great shot.  It is a perfectly okay shot.  But it may have the elements that captured,  you know, like the reflection of a sunset in the bay or some of those things that like  really good color saturation perhaps that tug at our brains and our eyes and say, Oh,  well, that's different than just some other snapshot. And so you do, like you feel that  dopamine of, Oh, you know what? Maybe this is a better picture than I thought it was because  these 10 people think it's great. And those 10 people may think it's great because they  like you. Right. And they think that they're not just in the photo picture or they are  happy that you were there for that experience. Right?  Were there being nice to you because they were meant to you last week?  All of my enemies are deciding to be nice for one week.  But this is, but I'll go ahead.  You know, before our last episode, we were talking about some photos that I took and you asked  me to send you one after I've edited it.  And I'm going to send it to you now because I forgot to send it to you.  And I was saying at the time, and I showed you the uncropped edited photo, I was saying  at the time, it's not a really interesting photo, but it's something I like about it.  Right?  And so we'll put this in the show notes and maybe with some others, I don't know if you've  gone through your photos to find a couple like this.  It's a picture I took in the evening in front of my house.  There's a wheat field across from my house.  Some of the wheat seeds blow over onto my front lawn.  Here, this is wheat that was fully grown mixed in with the grass.  You can't see that there's a drought in the grass is all brown.  It's golden hour and the light is on the wheat.  The detail, when you look at it at large, because this was with my like a Q360 megapixels,  detail of the little, I don't know what you call the little whiskers on the wheat is really  fascinating. I would not say it's a good photo, but for me, looking at this photo now,  this reminds me of the experience I had when I saw this and I went inside to get my camera  to capture it. If you remember in the previous episode we were talking about I went outside  and there was some water dripping off a rose bush and I went to get my camera. This was a similar  thing, not raining this day. It's like, ooh, okay, I want to capture this. And whether  anyone else thinks it's nice.  It doesn't matter because for me,  it's reminding me of that subtle feeling  I had looking at it saying,  this is a moment of beauty.  Well, and this is a moment of beauty.  And I know exactly what you mean.  There's that, it feels like a little tickle  in the back of my head that sort of activates  a different way of looking at something.  It's like, oh, we're in photography mode now.  I think I've used that in the past.  And it's kind of a dumb term,  but it's that aspect of something that I'm looking at,  I'm looking at in a new way, and I want to capture it.  And that, I think, is an even better dopamine response,  if it is even dopamine, but it's more satisfactory response  to making something like you're creating something you're not just looking at something or having someone  say, hey, this is a good picture because you experienced that. And I think that's one of the reasons  why I like doing landscape photography and I don't feel like I do enough of it. But so much of  landscape photography is you are getting out and doing it. Like, yes, you can come back with a lot  of great pictures or maybe you get skunked and the weather's bad and you don't get any good  pictures or you're forced to look for something else because the sky went crappy and there's just  no good light but maybe there's some really good macro opportunities nearby. That sort of thing.  But you're out there. You're experiencing it. You're problem solving in real time, which I think  A lot of people don't really give enough credit for in photography that so much of photography  is problem solving. Not only figuring out what exposure I should be at, which aperture I'm using,  how much depth of field should I expose, like all of that kind of stuff, but it's also  where can I make a composition that's interesting? Everything in front of me looks really boring,  but something here has caught my eye and I don't know what it is. And so you're exploring.  It's like all of that kind of exploration, visualization, looking at light and shadow,  like all those things kind of bombard you in a great way, which is the process.  It is the process. And the process puts you into a flow state, which  shuts everything else out around you as long as you're doing it.  Yes. And there's there's not a process of looking through Instagram other than,  I really should stop this and get up and go make a cup of coffee or something like that.  One more. I'm going to scroll one more. No, one, two more, three more.  Yeah. You know, it's 15 minutes later and you've forgotten.  I used to do that. Here we go. Mark my age.  I used to do that watching MTV. Do you remember MTV?  Music television? Yeah. I remember when MTV first started.  Yes. Same here. Same here.  I know I got old.  I am at all.  I am at all.  Three years old?  I wasn't three years old, but thank you for thinking that I'm a young young boy.  I would watch MTV in high school and because dear listener, I was a big nerd.  I know that's going to come as a big shock.  But on the weekends, I would be up late and basically I would watch MTV and think to  myself, all right.  The next video, if that's good, I'll watch it.  And then if I get to a bad video or a boring video, then I'll go to bed.  Sometimes it's 2.30 in the morning and your question and your life choices.  But having that process, getting back to photography, having that active participation of  photography, I think some people just sort of skim over that because they think I need  to just point my camera and capture something, which smartphones are really good at doing.  There's a whole lot of process that gets handled for you with a smartphone.  Trillions of operations per second.  You know what?  I'm looking forward to September because I think we're going to see the best cameras  that have ever been in an iPhone.  It's going to be the best iPhone ever.  It's going to be the best iPhone ever.  being able to work through it is really kind of a, this can sound cheesy, but it's kind of a gift  because you are forced to think in photography. And as much as photography is going and looking at  images, looking at like all the photography books that you have. Like that is also kind of a process,  But on the front side of that is, how am I going to make something?  I'm not just capturing something.  I am making something.  Even if it's something that you're capturing really quickly, like there was prep involved.  There was thinking, there were settings, there was all of that.  And I don't want to sound defeatous, but it just seems like that gets lost so often  because there's such a flood of images that we get exposed to.  I think also since we can take so many photos, we expect a percentage of them to be good  or great photos.  And when you had a roll of 36, if you had one or two that were good, you were happy,  right?  If you were photographing, I'm not talking about snapshots or family photos.  I'm talking about photographing, you know, in air quotes art photography.  You can just keep shooting on your phone until you run out of storage space.  And the number of keepers, as some people like to say, is you've got many more opportunities  to catch something that's interesting.  Like you could take 50 photos of the same thing from slightly different angles without worrying  about burning through roads of film.  And this gives you more opportunities.  However, having too much choice is also a problem.  And using choice as a crutch, using 50 photos as a crutch instead of taking the time to  compose one or two or three is also a problem. It means you're trying to go through the process  too quickly instead of, you know, doing the whole thing as you should from, you know, all the  things you're talking about the problem solving. And I think that's a really good term.  Process product and problem solving should be the title of the episode because I think that  the problem solving is probably the key to all of this and the key to any creative activity.  I'd like to compare this to cooking.  I know you'd like to cook.  I'd like to cook a lot too.  I bought a blender last week.  I haven't had a blender in decades.  And this morning I made some gazpacho,  pretty simple recipe, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, garlic,  a little bit of vinegar, and a little bit of olive oil.  It wasn't great.  Too much onion.  But the process of making it, for me cooking,  I don't mind when I fail when I cook  because it's a learning experience.  I don't know if I'll make a spatula again.  Last year, in order to prove I could,  I made both ketchup and mustard at home,  and neither of them were worth the many hours  it took to make them prepared to what you buy  in a supermarket.  But the process of making the gazpacho  is interesting enough that, okay,  the product is a gazpacho, which I ate for lunch,  which wasn't great,  and I'll maybe eat some tomorrow for lunch,  and it won't be great, and that's it.  But it's the process, it's more interesting than the results.  Over the weekend I made a quiche.  It was not my best quiche, but it was pretty good when I make a quiche.  It's generally quite good.  And then it's gone, right?  So any kind of thing that you make like that, it's the process that's important.  It's not eating the quiche that's important.  Well, that's also another example of a flow state too, because when you're cooking, I'll  typically have some music on or I'll be listening to a podcast.  There's other stuff going on, but it's mostly focused on ingredients and preparation and  following the recipe.  So that is also a focused flow state because I'm not thinking about work.  I'm not thinking about all the 100 other things that could distract my mind.  And so even though sometimes we'll be cooking something that might be either super easy or  more complicated with lots of ingredients, it's that process of just unplugging in a way to  be able to do something in a focused way.  So cooking, photography, art, that kind of thing.  And from my Gaspacho, it involves singing along to China Ketsan Flower and I know you  Ryder.  See?  There you go.  From the 51570 Grateful Dead show at the Fillmore East.  But see, that's part of the mood, isn't it?  The mood of music.  When I was into a podcast or an audio book when I'm cooking, it's too serious and I can't  be playful in the cooking, right?  I got to pay attention.  But when I'm listening to like a Grateful Dead concert or some other music, it opens up more  opportunities, I would say.  Yeah.  Another thing that I want to touch on while we're talking about this, because actually  what I thought of first when you sent me that article was not so much the social media aspect of it,  but that what are you shooting aspect of it? When you're shooting things for yourself. And I think  some of that is because I do a mix of photography for myself. I do a mix of photography, like I do  some paid photography, and it's been interesting. And you also do photography for articles.  And I do photography for articles too.  So there are different disciplines of the photography that I do.  And part of me taking this full-time job at CNET where I'm mostly writing, my photography  has really been scaled way back in terms of just me going out and taking pictures.  And I can feel that.  I mean before I was much more focused on photography because we have this podcast.  I would write about photography for DP review and things like that.  And so now that I'm not really putting myself in that space,  I'm realizing that I need to put myself in that space if that makes sense.  So it wasn't something that I was just doing all the time and thinking about all the time.  Now I need to be more deliberate about going out and making photos.  And that has been an interesting change because I'm back to asking, well, what do I want  to go take pictures of?  Not I need a sunset and I need to close up picture and I need to test whether this camera  has a good dynamic range, like all that.  Like, what do I want to go take pictures of?  And honestly, I've been kind of stumped on that.  So our West episode was about macro photography as an idea for things you can take pictures  of.  Just when you're in your house, you see something interesting.  You get your camera and say, how can I make an interesting photo of this tiny little  thing without all of the context around it?  Yeah.  And that's great as a really close buy thing.  But it also makes me wonder, well, okay, as an example, I've been down downtown Seattle  a couple of times for various reasons.  And so Pike Place Market is super touristy area, but it can be really great for street  photography and that sort of thing.  And there have been a few times when I've been down there or somewhere similar, there's  a Sunday market in my neighborhood of Ballard that's great.  And I've taken my camera thinking, well this would be a good opportunity to see people  and fruit stands and all the textures that you get from something like that.  And I just haven't really taken any pictures and just trying to figure out what do I want  to take photos of.  And I think it's kind of stumping me.  It's not that I have things that are not available to me.  It's what do I want to take picture?  You need the subjects to come out and grab you that when you see something, it says this  needs to be captured.  And that's the wheat in that photo.  Yeah.  That's the kind of thing I just walked out.  I saw this, I said this needs to be captured.  That's the kind of thing.  You need to be receptive to that.  And it's true that for you, it's hard  when you're doing all these photos for your work  in one way or another, it's hard to,  there's a term in Zen called Beginner's Mind  that the ideas that you should have  beginner's mind all the time,  where in the Beginner's Mind,  there are many possibilities in the expert's mind.  There are few.  You need to be beginner's mind thinking of all the things around you.  Everything around me is photographable.  It's just to decide as I like to say where you put the four corners of the frame.  So you need to get your brain into that photo receptive mode to start looking at things  and think like that.  You need to have moments when you go out and saying, I'm in photo mode.  And I'm not going to decide what I want to photograph.  I'm gonna just photograph whatever I come across  that looks photographable.  That is an excellent distinction.  It's not just that I went out with a camera.  I brought a camera as a just in case,  but I never got into that mental mode of,  okay, I'm gonna look for some photos.  I was more focused on, hey, you know,  it's a nice day and if I see something,  I will take a picture of it.  Right.  because I wasn't really thinking in a photographic way.  I never really took any pictures.  That's a really good point.  Yeah.  Hey, you're smart.  You know this stuff.  I think it's more that I've reflected on this  from not just the technical point of view,  from the artistic point of view  that I will get photography as both a craft and an art.  And that allows me to think of things differently  Instead of thinking, oh, I have to get the depth of field of this just right and I have to  expose for the highlights and make sure the histogram looks good and all that. I don't really think like that.  I'm not entirely F8 and B there. I generally keep my Wicca at F5.6. I don't care about the  blurry background stuff because I think that's a bit of a gimmick. And I like to just walk around  and think, wait till something is there and just reaches out to me and says, photograph me.  That sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. And being open for that. Right. Which is huge. Yeah.  Do we want to do snapshots this week? We could. I have a possible snapshot for  somebody that arrived today that I haven't used. Well, how about I start talking about a  movie that I watched I talked to you before we started recording. A 2024 film of the Count of  Monte Cristo. It's a French film and it's about three hours long and it's the most popular  French film for many years. I was going to Jeff and France, they don't count box office revenue,  like the US does. They count the number of people who go to see a film in the theaters.  And this had over nine million people going to see it. And in a period when people don't go to  movie theaters as often for a three hour film based on a, you know, 19th century novel, which,  I mean, there have been a hundred versions of it on film and TV. So people more OS know the theme.  but that's quite a feat and it's the same directors did a two-part movie of the  three musketeers the year before and apparently they're planning to do more along  that wine. It's a 1500 page novel so they obviously had to cut a lot out and  they created some characters and they removed a bunch of others. It's one of  my favorite novels but it's a really enjoyable movie. It's a superhero movie  without superheroes, right? Interestingly, if you look at the genesis of the superhero, if you  think of Batman as the superhero, not Superman, not the alien, but Batman, Batman was greatly  influenced by the shadow. Do you remember the shadow? Who knows what evil works in the hearts  of men? The shadow does mwahaha. Well, Mont Cranston, he had learned these secret art into  that and stuff like that. Well, the shadows influenced by the count of Monte Cristo, who after  being thrown in prison escaping, he becomes this guy with all these powers, not actual powers,  but skills. And you see him as he's getting revenge on a bunch of people and it's an enjoyable  three hours. So, count of Monte Cristo, you can get it probably on the iTunes store. Definitely  worth watching. Jeff, what did you just get today that you don't know if it's worth talking  about as a snapshot. Well, it is going to be worth talking about it because I have it in  my hand. And actually, it is kind of a camera thing, but in an odd way. I mean, hold it up  for you. That looks like a cable. It looks like a USB C kit. No, it looks like a microphone.  It looks like like a microphone. It looks like that thing that the doctor sticks down your throat  to see if you have an ulcer. Is that what it is? It's kind of like that. So this is a little  a little snake camera because...  ...because...  ...there is a bee.  ...and the bee is what they call it.  Endoscopy, this is an intelligent,  visual, industrial, endoscope.  Endoscope. Endoscope.  And basically, we had a scare or have a scar that there might be a pipe broken in my house  in a place that could be under the wood floors in the living room.  So not something that you can see easily or get too easily without tearing things apart.  And as part of troubleshooting, I thought, well, it would be great if I could just have  like one of those little sneaky cameras and just follow the pipe where the brake seems  to be and just see.  And then like in the past, I've thought about that and you have people who they put these  down sewers to check those kind of things out.  And of course, I went on Amazon and I was like, what would it cost for something like that?  Because I'm going to guess a question about 16 bucks.  $28.  So not too bad.  There may have been some $16 ones.  This one seemed like a good good.  Because it's basically fiber optics with the lens, right?  It's not like a fancy lens of any kind.  No, it's not fancy at any kind.  It has some LEDs at the end, so you get some light.  Right.  This one actually has a little tiny side camera in addition to a front camera, so you can  sort of take a little more.  And this just plugs into your phone.  Some of them have a dedicated screen and a scope, and you can pay more for that.  And of course, the professional ones will be three hundred times.  But the ones that Dr. Lewis.  Five few.  Yeah.  But I figured like for 28 bucks,  even if it's only semi working,  even if it only works partially well,  it's gonna be enough to tell me  whether or not there's water dripping from a pipe.  So I'm not knowing that could cost you a lot more.  It could cost a lot more.  So before I start trying to figure out,  okay, do I need to get an expert  who can take up the wood flooring  without just taking a chainsaw to it,  which is what a plumber would probably do  and calling a plumber and dealing with maybe,  house insurance, household insurance  and all of that kind of stuff.  Maybe I just spent $28 and take a look for myself.  So you just got this and you haven't used it yet.  Exactly.  So next episode, you'll have to take some screenshots  and tell us what the results were.  Yeah, possibly.  So far, the spot has not produced any more water  And so I have a feeling that this is a false alarm  and something got spilled and we didn't realize it.  But we'll see.  I would rather do this and find out  than wait to see if the wood floor buckles, right?  Yep.  Okay.  I like that idea.  Until next time.  Thank you.  Take care.  Until next time.

  "transcript": "Hello and welcome to Chooseify. Today on the show we have my good friend, Marla Tanner,  who's here again. She was on the show way back in episode 77 talking about advanced travel  rewards and that's a fun one to go back to listen to. But today she's here to talk about  living off the 4% rule. I think this is something that a lot of people are looking for that example.  Right? We always say the world revolves around stories and we're looking for that example of  of somebody who has reached by who is selling their assets,  who's living off the 4% rule.  And to hear about their journey,  to hear about the mechanics of it,  to hear how this all went down and what's really neat.  So more than I knew would be the perfect person  to talk about this, but she actually just did this  as a presentation at Camp Mustache very recently.  So this is the ideal time to have her on  because she's actually run the numbers.  She's run the numbers both on her own life  and an alternate scenario of worst case scenario Marla,  essentially, which is really, really cool to see how this would have worked out and how it did work out and  interestingly and the spoiler is it would have worked out beautifully even in the worst case scenario and  It's just really wonderful to see someone  living this incredible five life and  Going through the prototypical path and I absolutely love it. I think you're gonna love this episode with that welcome to choose that fine  I'm going to go to the next slide.  Marla, my great friend.  Oh, it is so good to see you.  Thanks for coming back in the show.  Thanks for having me, Marla.  Great to see you too.  Yeah, it has been.  Goodness.  It's been almost nine years since we met at Camp Mustache, probably with Southeast before  it was called Camp Fi in Florida.  That's right.  That's what's going to be a great podcast to have even launched.  I'm at both you and John with them.  That was absolutely wild.  Yeah, became fast friends there.  have stayed obviously in touch ever since. And yeah, you were the person who I thought of when  it came time to think about somebody who is truly living off of the 4% rule. I think there's been a  lot of talk in the community lately of, is this real? Are there actually people who are doing this?  Can I actually sell my assets when the time comes? And I've kind of taken a little bit of a  kind of hard line approach on this where I say, like, okay, if you've put a plan and this is not your  story obviously, Marla, but just just for every way, because I'm trying to like tough  in everybody up a little bit, which is, hey, you put a plan in place for 10 to 20 years  and you've won.  You've won the game.  You've reached five.  If you're going to chicken out because you think you can't lean into five minutes of  discomfort and just log into your brokerage and just click sell that one time.  Like you're going to give up success.  Five success for the next five decades because you're worried about logging in and pressing  sell one time because that's what it is. Right? Marla, I imagine you had a little bit of discomfort  that first time because you saved for your career. And then you went from a saver to somebody who  now has to live off their assets. And I would imagine I'm putting words in mouth. I'd love to hear  the psychology of this. But I would imagine that very first time it was maybe a little bit weird.  But you know what? You're an adult and you did it and you won the game. So that's kind of my  my hot take on this. But let's go back to that. So you retired in 2013, right?  Yes. I went to the first Chautauqua, so that's the JL Collins event at the time that was in Ecuador.  And as soon as it got announced, and the speakers were going to be JL Collins, Mr. Muddy-Moustache,  JB Roth, I was like, I need to buy a ticket, I need to bring my numbers because I think I can do this.  And so I basically retired on the spot after showing them my numbers.  Wow, oh that just, that's really cool.  I don't think I even knew that aspect of the story.  That's really neat.  Well part of it was my competitive nature,  which has largely gone away since retirement,  but there was a guy, Jason, who came down in the morning,  we were all during our introductions,  and he's like the same age as I am,  and he says I just retired two weeks ago,  sold my health, moved, and I was like,  he can do it.  Ha ha ha ha.  He can do it too.  Or in that Jason, I can do it too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So yeah, I think it's true that when you start having to sell,  you start to go back into the little timing the market.  So if we'd lost the compunction to time the market when we're buying,  I think you do go back to trying to time the market when you're first starting  to sell.  So learning to automate that and not be not chicken out of you just said is  probably still a lesson I've got to learn.  because I'm probably withdrawing more like,  oh, the market's really up right now.  I'll take out a bunch.  And I definitely keep more cash.  So when we talk about the whole optimizing,  I think in the beginning,  I was definitely like a hardcore optimizer.  And as you gain, it's been 10 years now  that I've been retired.  As you get more comfortable with the numbers  and you see your portfolio continue to grow  and grow beyond what you expected,  I start to say, maybe I don't want to optimize,  maybe I just want to have a little bit more of a cash cushion  at all times so that I don't  check it out when I stick with the plan.  Okay, I can't share.  Yeah, and again, tough love aside,  this is natural, right?  Like that's the thing,  but that's what we have to understand.  This is natural to be nervous about it.  It absolutely is.  And even for you who's been doing this, right?  Absolutely.  And I think it is this full learning to flex a new muscle.  And I think this has been talked about,  I think Pete actually wrote a post about it  where it's like, we've all gotten really good  having a strong savings muscle, but this idea of a spending muscle is new and something  that we really got to try to work on.  Yeah, I remember I think the post was something on the order of the skill of spending.  I wrote about it in my newsletter.  I loved when Pete came up with that phrase and it's, yeah, we've had this skill of saving for  so long.  But really at some point, when you were just rolling in abundance and that we're going to  talk about that also in terms of how well your portfolio has done over the last 10 plus  years, all the while with drawing. When you're rolling in abundance, you really do have  to come to the point and say, all right, look, I need to start spending this money and I need  to get good at that. And that's just part of the game. I think that's what a lot of people  like about five is like, you can gamify this. And it's almost like, it's a little bit of  keeping score. It's not keeping up with the Joneses. We don't want to get into that obviously.  maybe if you reframe it to,  hey, spending is part of my new game now.  Maybe just maybe that'll help you spend a little bit more?  I think one of the messages that maybe  dissuades people from trying to be a person  who retires like I do,  where I don't try to earn any other income,  is we sort of diminish somebody like me  in our general five talk where we say,  if you think you're gonna sit around on the couch  and eat bon-bonds or go to the beach  drink margaritas, you're not going to do that, you're probably going to find another way to make  money. And I think by us saying that and by those of us who consume phi media, we propagate that  myth because we wind up saying, oh, nobody sits around and does nothing. Like you're, you know, 43  years old, you're gonna just be like a 65 year old retiree, probably not. And how many 65 year  old retirees just sit around and do nothing? So I'm not saying I sit around and do nothing, but I  don't make money. So I find other ways to have purpose and meaning and fun. Mostly fun. I think  that's the truth of it all. And maybe part of our psychology that you were alluding to  is this guilt. Like, are we deserving of a life that's just fun?  Yeah. I mean, that's a great point. And clearly, I'm guilty of charge. You probably used  almost exact verbatim of something you've heard me say 400 times, right? Like, are you really  going to sit around and sipping umbrella drinks is what I say. And I think I understand as  you're saying it that the implicit thing there is, oh, you're going to earn money in  somewhere. And I strongly, I know that I've said those words. But I think to me, it's always,  you're going to do something interesting. Is really the message that I'd love to get across?  Not that you need to earn money because I find that a very uncoupelling case, that you're going  to earn money or you have to earn money or something about your self-worth is I have to earn money in  some way. Like that to me doesn't seem like winning. But don't you think we use that argument as a way of  saying reassuring? It's the argument that you can go ahead and pull the plug and we need to find  another way to encourage people that your plan is solid and you do have enough and you can go ahead  and pull the plug and the chips will follow where they may and that's part of what's exciting and  fun and an adventure. So you can pull the plan and start your adventure as soon as your plan says  that you're ready and you're not going to regret it. And when we, you're going to talk about the  presentation that I just did, when we presented that and talked to a room of 50 people,  how many people who are already retired, wish that they'd retired earlier. It was like,  you know, 80% of the room. Some people couldn't because they retired. Like I did right when  when they hit the number, but most people, we did too long.  Yeah.  No, you're, I mean, listen, you're exactly right.  And yeah, I think it is almost like an end around  to help convince people, hey, you can do this.  But to your extremely hard line of reasoning,  do we need that end around?  Can't we just say, this just works, right?  Because that's what most of us know.  This just works.  It simply works.  But there's so much fear.  You know this.  I know this, there's so much fear in this community.  Because a lot of us are scarce in your mind,  that a lot of us have been savers our whole lives.  It's hard to get over that psychological hump.  And yeah, I guess probably some people do use that  as an end around for it's gonna be okay.  Take a deep breath.  But I think, and your presentation talks about this  of having a little bit of flexibility,  maybe even being willing to go up or down 10 to 20%  in your expenses in a given year,  based on how things work.  Like, that might do it.  Maybe saving that amazing trip,  and I'm not putting words in your mouth here,  Marla Banyman's, but like saving that amazing trip  for a year that the market was incredible.  And that doesn't mean you're not gonna travel every year.  Obviously, I know you travel all the time  and we're gonna talk about that too.  But just maybe a little bit of adjustment,  but at the heart of it, this just simply works.  I do think, yes, it does work.  And I'm a good case study to prove it out.  And also that doesn't take away that you might need a few years of it to believe it.  So I think you can look back now and be a lot more comfortable when you're me.  And I guess when we were talking about like you telling people that it works when you still earn money and run a successful podcast.  Or most of the other bloggers and podcasters and writers are still earning money.  That becomes part of the problem where the consumers of that content are like, well, maybe I also have to earn money.  because who is there in the fire community that isn't still earning money?  Yeah, it is a very interesting thing.  And I had an email recently from a woman named Nicole who wrote in about almost that verbatim.  It was basically saying, like, if the people who talk about this the most don't quote-unquote trusted,  why should I trust it?  And, well, A, I think I would just argue the premise of the entire thing,  which is, frankly, if you look at, let's say,  a broad swath of a thousand five bloggers and podcasters.  I think just knowing what I know about online business,  95 to 99% of them are earning $0 or less.  They're essentially, they're paying for the right,  to write their journal online as opposed to write their journal  in a notebook.  But it's hard.  And I had a conversation, a group of us,  a five group of us have walks here in Virginia, in Richmond, a couple of times a week in  a perfect world. I make it infrequently, but one of the more recent ones, I talked with a couple  of my real good friends and they were saying the very same thing, which is like, oh, but all these  bloggers and bloggers. I'm like, oh, guys, come on. Like these are just regular. Just because  someone decided to grab a domain name for $12 that go daddy and spend $4 a month for hosting.  doesn't mean there's some mythical creature that is a blogger. Like they decided to take  their notebook and put it online for you for free and it's costing them to do so. So everyone  just hear what I'm saying. 95% of personal finance and certainly finance independence  bloggers and podcasting make zero dollars or less. So I don't think that should make you trust  them less or more, but it is just simply the truth. They're not a different animal. They're not  different species. They're just regular people who took their journal and put it online for your  benefit. So stop castigating them as if they're weird people. They're just they're wonderful.  But more than you can tell this gets me a little hot and bothered because it's just people just  don't understand. And it really is important. Like we shouldn't minimize these people just because  they decided to put their journal online. Yeah, if anything, we should we should hold them up because  I think we all become evangelists of five where we really want to share this amazing life and  and this ability to get off the hamster wheel to quote  another good podcaster.  Yeah, like we wanna share the story  and see how many people, you know,  and also maybe track our journey  and also, you know, give ourselves some kind of purpose  and that's where a lot of people have turned  to becoming producers of content.  And I would argue it also comes a little bit from guilt  because I think we, it's hard to, you know,  live in this abundance and not feel guilty when you see  almost everybody you know, struggling and working so hard.  And that's the reality of the sort of North American lifestyle  is everybody's working really hard and running  on this treadmill and somehow not saving  because they're big spenders and we're just not.  Yeah, I hear you.  And it is interesting.  I'm finally in the first part of my adult life  where I'm really flexing some fly muscles, which is actually  really cool.  And I know I've talked a lot about some of the changes  in my personal life, or I haven't talked a lot about it,  but I've talked in passing a couple of times  about changes in my personal life.  And yeah, I mean, it's really interesting now  to try to look at my online life, my website and podcasts  and such and really kind of compartmentalize that.  And I've been doing a lot more traveling  and it's really been great.  And I'm able to do things now  that I simply would not have been able to do  if I wasn't fine.  So even though I am still earning some money  covers my expenses from Tuesday. I'm still living, I believe that I'm living a  five life and I'm seeing the benefits of it and it's remarkable and frankly,  if Tuesday, if I went away tomorrow, which it's not, don't know anybody  where I put, if we went away tomorrow, I would be fine and I'd be living all  four percent just like you, Marla. And I would gleefully sell every month or  however I'll set aside it and it would work just as well. So hopefully it  doesn't diminish my efficacy as someone who talks about this just because I'm  I'm not currently selling assets.  Anyway, this is a very long, very long preamble.  So, okay, we're gonna get into your presentation.  It's funny because I thought of you, again, my great friend,  as somebody who would be awesome to talk about  living off of their assets before even knew  that you did this presentation at Camasas recently.  So, this is just like another benefit  that you actually have it written down  and we can really go through numbers.  But, let's start at the beginning.  So, you retired in maybe mid to late 2013.  We'll say you started tracking your numbers for real in 2014, according to the presentation.  So give everybody a sense of like, we're where you financially, what were your expenses?  What did your financial life look like that?  So getting to the numbers of having this mythical million dollars, which I would say it was  pretty close to what I had when I went and had Mr. Monday, my stush Pete in particular,  look at my numbers.  I had about a million dollars saved and that had been from 15 years of working and I realized  that my savings rate, this was way before I ever had heard a glimmer of anything to do with  financial independence or early retirement. I was always a great saver and when I look at it now,  I think I saved about 50% of my income for my whole career and strangely after 15 years,  I had about $1 million and my spending was always very low. So I think I was ready then. So that's  where the money came from and then going back. So yes, preparing for this presentation,  which I did with one of the organizers I've can't master. She basically helped me because I'm not very  organized. I'm not very good at charts and spreadsheet. So she was the mastermind, but  we looked at my numbers and it was real. It was really fun to kind of look back at this 10 years  and see what happened to that million dollars. Like, okay, there was a million dollars and then I  spent about this much and I kind of did follow the exact path that's recommended in the plan  for five. If you had a million dollars in 2013 and you took 4% out so 40,000 and you adjusted it for  inflation and took out that amount every year, what would you have enough to live hopefully for  a long and abundant retirement? So my example shows where I'm out after 10 years and my end result  is 2.3 million in my portfolio and I'm currently taking out 52,000 a year. So that's the 10-year plan.  So starting with a million, living what I would say is a very abundant life,  increasing my withdrawals based on inflation and obviously we've had some big increases to inflation  in the last couple years and then winding up taking out 52,000 my portfolio now and I'm 55 years old  is sitting at 2.3 million.  Mike, drop.  Yeah, yeah, my jump.  And we can end the episode there.  Good, that is incredible.  That is absolutely incredible.  Yeah, I'm looking at this, the chart, and it's really something.  And it's just, yeah, the numbers don't lie.  You have annual return of each, including down years, like 2018, 2022,  the inflation, your exact withdrawal, and your urine portfolio.  And so I just wanted to take one quick sidebar, which is the, as you're saying, the mythical million dollars.  And it's funny because I think back in the day, it was always like, oh, we can do this.  If your life cost $40,000, using the 4% rule, you just multiply your annual expenses by $25,  gets you to a million dollars.  And that's your fine number.  But that was always just like you said, mythical, because as we know, this is all depending on what your life costs.  the number works the same. If your life costs $20,000, your  flight number would be $500,000. If your life costs $80,000, your  flight number would be $2 million. And onward and upward from there.  So I don't want anybody to think for one second that $40,000 a year and  $1 million are the only flight numbers. Of course, neither of us were saying  them are, but it is important to take that little sidebar.  Well, and I think to look back and say, okay, that was in 2024.  So I think what we did conclude after preparing the presentation and really looking at it is,  I think it's time, like obviously we were using a million on 40 as nice round numbers when everybody  was starting to talk about fire. But I think that if we're going to use nice round numbers, we are  looking at more like 52,001.3 million as your numbers. And that hopefully starts to make people go,  okay, well, can I live on that type of expense? And I know when Mr. Money Mass Dash, for example,  says he's still living on, you know, sub 30,000. If you have a paid off house, you know,  your cost of living can go way down. And for me personally, I rent now. I sold my house.  So you, you can really anticipate what your expenses are and plan accordingly.  Yeah, I think this is really important because I think people, even though we say at the beginning  of five, like you really just need to get this down on paper. Like what is your life actually cost?  It's still, it's hard for people. And I think they overestimate what their expenses are because  Like you said, your savings rate was 50% for your 15-year career.  And let's just look at $50,000 of annual expenses.  Okay, so if your annual expenses were $50,000,  let's just say at the time you're working,  and you had a 50% savings rate,  we usually, there's some ambiguity around this,  but the way that I look at it is, it's your after-tax money.  So you would take your gross income,  less your tax liability, to get down to your after-tax income,  and then that's where I would look at the savings rates.  So working backwards, okay, someone making approximately $140,000 an income.  So just top line say $140,000, my total tax burden is 30%.  I think for most people it's less than that, but let's just say that.  So then you get down to about $100,000 after tax, and then all of that $100,000,  you're saving 50, and you're spending 50.  So interestingly, Marlin, in that scenario, right?  Like this person is making $140,000, they think they're anchored to that amount.  on some level. Like, oh, I need to somehow cover 140,000. But no, no, no. Like, the two main components  of that are the taxes and the savings that you need to save dramatically to get to  five and 15 to 20 years. Right? So your annual expenses are nowhere near that gross income. In  your case, it's about a third. And I think that's probably fairly reasonable. So again, another  sidebar, but I think it's just really important for people to understand, like, it has nothing to do  with your current income because by definition in your current income you're going to have a  significant amount of tax and you're going to have a huge amount of savings to get to fight.  So it's just a really important thing.  I think it's really important and like interestingly when you're looking at that sort of when  we're looking at hypothetical numbers this $140,000 gross salary you don't have to be earning  that for your whole 15 years or 10 year work life. Like my salary and obviously this is back in  Listen, I'm talking about how many years ago it was, but you know, I never earned more than 130,000 and that was only in my last two or three years of my career.  So if you're always saving a 50%, the rest of that money is compounding over that much, much longer period.  So when we all start talking about oh, everybody has to be a tech bro or make this huge amount of money. I was not a tech bro or gal.  Sorry, some people will get that reference.  So, whoa.  But this is what happens as you see  like the stock market chart going up your salary goes up too.  So both of those things are all working together  as does compounding.  Yeah, and like you said, and also in my case,  I was a CPA, I never made more than $100,000 in my job.  So, and.  Well, mine was Canadian dollars to be fair.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  But yeah, two point also is when you have your housing  cost under control, like you're saying with Pete,  housing costs under control, you don't have a car payment.  Your life just simply doesn't cost that much.  I think people also overestimate that head.  And it's pretty darn hard  when you don't have a car payment  and you don't have a house payment  to spend more than 40 or 50 thousand dollars.  I'm not saying it's impossible.  So don't yell at me from your car, your seat,  wherever you're listening to this.  But it really is pretty darn hard.  I mean, to spend more than $4,000 a month  just on random food and entertainment,  like that's not the easiest thing to do month after month.  So it's just, again, further bolstering the case mentally for people.  I was like, oh, this is doable.  Oh, this does make sense.  So that $40,000, that was your exact annual expenses in 2013, 2014, right?  Yeah.  I mean, like I say, I haven't been the greatest of trackers, but I think if you do the math  based on my salary, like I'm not exaggerating where the money came from.  So I did sell a house along the way.  So I had other income come in.  But in terms of my spending, I never had lifestyle inflation after I retired.  I never inflated my lifestyle.  And I can look back at my spending and go, yeah, this is pretty accurate.  Like ups and downs probably where some years I spent more than 40.  But I don't think I ever went over 52 even in my highest spending years.  Okay.  Thanks for listening to Choose a Vai and for all your support of our mission here.

I think what a lot of people want to know is the actual mechanics of how much you  took out, like where you keep your cash, how frequently you sell. Do you sell like the entire  year's worth on January 1st? You do it month by month. You talked about earlier like I guess  It's not necessarily automated. It sounds like so talk us to that because I think this is the part that really gets people a little bit nervous.  I think this is probably a do as I say not as I do come to worry, but I've become comfortable and I think if we look at my 10 years of retirement,  the year that was the most stressful for me was the COVID crash for a whole bunch of reasons in terms of what my travel lifestyle and COVID  COVID didn't really go together very well.  So it was a tough time.  It was definitely an existential crisis.  But the financial part watching that portfolio dropped  so dramatically, so quickly, was really scary.  But what I did was I went and looked  in all my investment accounts and saw how much  was sitting in cash.  Like I don't do the drip or the reinvesting of anything.  I use a lot of my dividends and those type of payments  to just be part of, like, keep it in cash.  So I kind of totaled it all up and realized, oh,  I've got more than two years worth of cash or cash equivalents sitting there.  And I think like at times over this 10 years, I'm like, oh, I have too much in cash.  But I think like when you talk about the sleep at night strategy,  I think I've realized and certainly seeing, you know, basic interest rates  on high interest savings accounts going up, I feel more and more comfortable  at just keeping about two years worth of cash around.  So I'm still selling.  And as I say, I'm kind of timing, attempting to time the market,  which I don't think is the recommended approach.  But I would say once a year, I'm probably looking at my money,  looking at where the market's at, and selling to pad to keep that number  at around two years of cash.  OK, gotcha.  That makes sense.  So right.  Once a year, maybe twice a year, you were selling to either good.  Yeah, like you said, either the full year's worth of expenses,  even though it's not for that current year, you could cut money  It's fungible, right?  You could kind of make the argument that it is.  But regardless, you're trying to keep roughly  a two year buffer of cash just for your own sleep at night test.  Is that a real clear?  And I guess the other thing that makes my investments  a little bit different than they would be  if I had known about five at the beginning  of my investing career is I still have a lot of individual  stocks that I have to manage the sale of.  And so that's where a lot of the money comes from  in terms of my selling.  So my stuff that's in VTI would be the equivalent of what mine is.  I haven't started selling that.  I'm mostly trying to sell and manage my capital gains on the stuff that I bought before  I learned about ETFs.  Gotcha, gotcha.  Okay, that makes sense.  And yeah, like you said, you don't reinvest the dividends, but clearly from what I'm hearing  of having significant amount of index funds, you're not a quote-unquote dividend investor.  It's just, hey, they're sending me these dividends.  So instead of reinvesting them and selling them,  I'm just gonna take them as part of my annual sale.  And then let's say your life does cause 52,000 now  and I'm just making this up.  You get 20,000 in dividends, right?  Like, let's say about 1%, right?  So you would then only need to sell  about $30,000 of funds each year.  So it's functionally, it's kind of the same deal,  but it's just you're doing it in a two-pronged way.  Yeah, and I'm trying to manage my income tax in the same way to make sure that I don't hit.  So I'm selling so that I'm keeping myself in a low tax or a mid to low tax bracket on my sales between my cap gains and my regular income that comes from the sale.  Okay, does that make sense?  It does make a lot of sense to write the dividends regardless of whether you take them as cash or reinvest them dividends are taxable income in the current year.  Exactly.  So that's going on your tax.  I know you're in Canada, but I'm talking with American tax, but I imagine it's substantially  similar if anything's different.  Obviously, let me know.  But yeah, so that's a taxable event.  But then, right, in America, we're going to get a pretty big standard deduction.  And there's that 0% long-term capital gains tax rate.  So yeah, you can kind of massage to take some money out of, I guess, selling for your  taxable brokerage account and realizing those long-term capital gains.  But paying, again, in America, you'd be paying 0% tax on that, which is pretty remarkable.  Up to somewhere in the vicinity of like $96,000 of taxable income, which is crazy.  If for American-American.  I don't know about that situation.  We pay a 50% tax rate on the top.  Yeah.  Wow.  50.  But I'm still selling it at a lower marginal tax rate because I'm keeping it in  come to low. So my tax rate is, you know, it's not zero. It's still probably 22% something like that.  So yes, we do pay higher taxes in Canada. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Okay. But get a vote for our taxes. Let me tell you.  Yeah. I believe that you do. I know you do. We've talked about that many a time.  So Marla, in terms of obviously we talked about inflation and on this presentation, you did,  you're actually going by the actual inflation. But your expenses aren't always going in lockstep  with inflation. Like some years, if you had sold a paid off house and now you're renting,  your expenses presumably are going to be more, but then you also have extra money that's now  sitting in your investment account to draw down on. But when do you actually look at what is my  my life costs. Do you reassess that every year? Do you get bothered with that? Did you even  care?  I used to, but I think as I said, I've gotten comfortable over the years to see, especially  riding out some of these drops in the market. And I'm just looking at how much my portfolio  has grown. I really don't stress about it anymore.  Okay.  So I do keep some level of track of my spending based on credit card statements. So I pay  attention to money. I pay attention to prices. I've always been that way. I always will  be that way. So I know what my spending is based on the fundamentals of rent and what I spend on my  credit card. So between those two I'm like yeah I'm fine. Right. And honestly we didn't talk about  travel rewards but my travel expenses even though I'm probably out of the country 180 days a year  is what I've tracked. My travel expenses are still really low. I'm able to do a lot with you know  three or four kind of card sign up bonuses a year and being really good at looking for a deal.  You are the best person I know at that and I still you're constantly telling me about all these  different things you're doing and I wish my brain was agile enough to understand it all the time.  But yeah, you're you're remarkable. I know we had you on the way back.  That's part of the joy that if people start looking at what is my purpose in my passion, it probably  is like planning the next trip. So that takes a lot of time. It takes a couple hours, you know,  probably three, four hours a week of watching all the different travel blogs and planning things  and skipping up deals when they come up. Yeah. And the cool thing about you is you make this  friend family community event of travel, right? Like that is the joy that I see you just living  into every single year. It's amazing. Like you're always going on these grand  adventures with all sorts of different people and hopefully someday I'll be  able to join you maybe five years from now and my daughters are both in  college and beyond and but yeah less anybody think that you're living some  miserly life. It's the polar opposite. You're traveling everywhere.  Interesting. Well and all these friendships that I've made through  five, it's amazing you know you sort of collect friendships through your life  and I'm happy that I have lots of friends from way before that and people  aren't part of the five community. But once you find some of your five friends,  they tend to have more free time to do fun things together. So yeah, some really great friendships  and the more times you go to the different events, the more you really build on these friendships,  and then you do want to go on trips together or do something fun. So yeah,  and lots of lots of fun adventures. Yeah, I love that. And it's so neat as I learn more about the  the community and meet more people.  I know they're just all sorts of different groups  of people who just, like you said,  they just travel together.  No Becky Heptig, who used to be one of the co-hosts  of catching up to five and her husband Stephen.  They travel all over the world with their group of five friends.  And I'm constantly seeing you travel.  Obviously, there are all these events.  And now a lot more of them are going international,  which is really cool.  So Chris and Knapp is now doing the five friends travel.  And Amy has the Bollywood treat.  even Stephen Boer has doing the Camp 5 Spain.  I think he's planning on expanding it.  So yeah, it's really very cool.  And I would add in.  I've done the Go With Less trip.  So you've had even Tim from Go With Less on.  Of course.  And she's just really seen a need for people  who are really global nomads who  want to find some community while they're on the road.  And her Facebook group has facilitated all these amazing  friendships.  And she organizes lately.  It's been quite a bit of cruises.  And I was like, I'm not trying to really like the idea of cruises  because you're not seeing much.  But the cruises themselves are the time to meet the people  and become friends.  And then when the cruised dogs, everybody's now,  so in this example, everybody was in Australia.  And then those same people, like 25 people from the ship,  are all traveling around Australia.  And we're all meeting up with each other more times  of doing more things together.  So that type of friendship building where you go,  I'm on a Christopher nine days of 26 days.  You really get to know people.  You are a captive audience in that case.  And yes, we actually have a huge, huge five community in Australia too,  which I didn't realize until I went to Bali.  And yeah, there's an even an event there.  My good buddy Rob runs an event.  I think it's every October.  So that's something we'll have to add to the calendar as well.  So maybe a future year will all head down to Australia.  That would be fun. Well, and honestly, I had thought I need to save Australian New Zealand and go for a really long time because it's so far at the time difference on the cost.  And then I went and I'm like, I'll be back within like two or three years. That's so amazing.  Nice. That's super cool. Yeah.  Going back to your numbers real quick. So you're now at about 2.3 million, which means according to the 4% rule,  you could live off of a little more than $90,000, which is amazing.  And you're only pulling a little more than half that Marla. That's why I know.  I know. It's crazy.  So what's so wild is you are living this incredible life of abundance.  Right? Like you're traveling, like you said, 180 days a year.  You love looking for these deals and all these things.  Like, but yet you're only withdrawing of a 2% of your nest egg now.  Now, clearly, clearly, unless anyone misunderstand that,  Marla retired on 4% she's been living off of this the entire way and just by virtue of it all working right like it works and that was even amidst some craziness right with covid and such and and there were scary times obviously when you saw your portfolio drop 30 or 40% in a month or two period.  This is not all rainbows and unicorns, but like we often talk about like most people are going to die  with significantly more money than they started that point of fight with they just are and I mean one of the you are on the  trajectory to have just more money than you could possibly imagine in essence. Do you ever think about?  I'll turn of things to do with the money  different like spending habits. Does that ever cost your mind?  It does and I think you know it was what a year and a half ago that the  Die with zero  Everybody was like losing their mind about it and talking about it  But I think what concerns me is I think that those stories of all of us  You've been retired for a longer amount of time and having too much money quote-unquote  I think it left the listeners and consumers of media feeling like who are you like now instead of like convincing us  that our plan is solid and we can retire on the 50,000 a year.  Instead, it's like, oh, poor ass,  we need to start spending more money  and having exotic trips and that kind of thing.  So I'm reluctant for your listeners to leave them.  Like, I don't think that's really the heart of my story.  And yes, I thought about, you know,  mostly I've been thinking about philanthropic uses  for any excess and how to do good with the money  and what my plan is that way.  But yes, I'll splurge on the odd thing now.  And I'm not an idiot.  I can see that I can spend more money.  So I probably will.  But within reason, and I mean, those habits of,  like I feel proud about being a frugal person  and not wasteful.  And I care about the environment.  And when you think of Pete's original message  for his blog that Mr. Mandy Mass-Sash  is really a message about caring about the environment  and being anti-consumer.  So I guess that's where I, you know,  stories of all these exotic trips for campfires and all the different events that people can do,  those are not important to our happiness. Those are nice to have that if you want to splurge  fantastic, but I want to hopefully be, you know, you asked me on to talk about can you live on the  4% yes you can. If you wind up with more money, you know, as they say it's a good problem to have,  and let's all get generous and do good things with that money.  That's yet another mic job moment Marla.  It's absolutely true.  No, it's absolutely true.  And I love what you said about just being proud about being frugal.  And frankly, I'm proud of being frugal.  I always have been.  And that's just it's deeply ingrained in me.  And I don't like being wasteful.  I am also cognizant of the fact that it's funny because I suspect that I, my fervor  for I was zero led to some of that time period,  everybody talking about it,  because I know I talked about it here,  and she's a vialod.  But to me, it wasn't the concept.  Like a lot of that book was not that great, frankly.  But it was the seasons of life  that I think that really impacted me,  and especially with daughters that are growing up,  really fast, and are gonna be out of the house really soon.  I think it gave a naturally frugal person,  like me, maybe the license to do one or two things  that I probably wouldn't have done otherwise.  And did it mean that all of a sudden,  I'm a different person and I'm spending like a free-reeling,  crazy person?  No, of course not.  But when presented with a trip to go to England  and Barcelona with my daughters to see some amazing concerts  like Taylor Swift, I'm like, well, of course I'm gonna do that.  You know, of course, even though part of me says,  oh, but it's a, you know, it's X number of thousands of dollars  in Yada, Yada, Yada.  So I think that's where that opened my mind a little bit.  But yeah.  with you. And I think, like, the book was still really useful. I just think I've read enough  about how it kind of turned off a lot of people who were on their path. So it was like people  who were underspending, talking to each other about how to live a life that's more abundant,  which I think is very valuable and true. But I think these one time expenses and one time splurges,  you know, even if you do those one time things 10 times, 15 times, 20 times, there's still like,  they're just a byproduct of having extra money and yes you should you should say yes  like we should all be saying yes to a life of abundance and we shouldn't say no because we're  frugal so I think that in itself is a very positive message but if it's a year where you're  portfolio is not doing great and the rate of inflation is really high then that's a great year  to hunker down and you know not spend a whole lot of money and we have that muscle and I think  that's the part that's so wonderful about five is like you're so trained on saving and being  good with money that's not going to be a problem for you. Like what we learned in preparing for the  presentation was that if you wanted a hundred percent success of your portfolio and you in a bad  year where it was looking bad all you had to do was cut your spending by 15 percent in that one year  and you would be back to a hundred percent success. So I think we can all find 15 percent of savings  like clearly you're not going to go to Europe for Taylor Swift in that year, but you should go  three or four times in a year where the markets are turning up 24%. Right? Yeah. That's really  interesting. So in that in that down year, a mere 15%, you actually told me something interesting,  which is a thought experiment. I think we should all undertake and love for you to explain it is  the concept of fixed cost. And as your argument is fixed costs aren't always quite as fixed as  people read themselves to believe.  Yeah, I think that's true.  Like, if you look at the major categories of fixed costs,  a lot of them are things like food.  And I think we all know that our food,  like, adjusting our restaurant spending  and our grocery shopping, that alone  is a huge portion of your expenses in a given year  once you're retired.  And I know we could all cut back  of those spendings and cook from home  and have some more simple food and not  treat ourselves as much. We can cut our alcohol purchasing budget back a little, all those kind  of things. So 15% is a very easy number to save. So I would encourage everyone to look at their  fixed expenses and think about how fixed they really are. And as we said, even I think when we were  talking about this before, we started recording, even with your housing. Like, maybe you have more  house than you need. And in a not so good year, you get a roommate or rent a room just for like a month.  just a month, committing the difference.  So, or rent your own house and go to Mexico.  You know, rent out your house and go on a trip  to a lower cost of living area.  So the whole geographic arbitrage, I think, is exciting.  Like, if you're still working and you're on this path  and you're dreaming about what your life can find,  is like the main thing I can tell you is it's flexible.  Like, all the lack of flexibility you have  when you're a working person goes away  and your life becomes so much more flexible.  Yeah, I love that concept of, well, a flexibility.  I think that is just so incredibly true.  And be like, again, looking at something  that you think is fixed and realizing, oh no,  this is not fixed at all.  I actually have a lot of, a lot of wiggle room here,  especially if you're only talking,  like you said, 15%, so 15% on $40,000,  there's only $6,000, right?  Like, I know I was recently introduced to something  called, I think it's Furnish Finder  and a friend of mine rents out a bedroom in her house  to travel nurses for a couple of months a year.  And that's just a really great way.  It's like very vetted and you can find people  who're just gonna be there for a couple of months.  And that's a great way to earn some extra income  from empty bedrooms that are just sitting there.  And that's just, again, that's a cool way of doing this.  And you never know.  You might meet interesting people,  make lifelong friends.  You just never know who passes through.  And yeah, I mean, that was just a cool thing that I just never, never been presented with.  I have friends who did the traveling nurses thing.  And when they were first telling me about it, I was like, what are you talking about?  They're five friends and they kept referring to the person as my friend's name is Adam.  Adam's night nurse.  And they found a nurse that worked nights.  So I never even, so she rented out a room in their house.  She worked nights.  And then she slept during the day. They never even crossed paths.  And they made, you know, X amount of money that helped them with their savings.  Right. That's really, really cool.  And I mean, it just sounds cool, Brad. Like, if you had Brad's night nurse, I mean,  you get some good street credit.  I don't know how we can reply to that one, but yes, you're exactly right.  You could cut that out if you want.  Oh, that's thin.  and I'm not saying that.  So I know in your presentation,  you had the less lucky Marla,  which is basically like,  if you retired at the worst possible time,  and how this would have worked.  So let's talk through this  because like you said,  the heart of why you're here is to talk about,  hey, this is real, I'm doing this.  The 4%, I'm selling assets, I'm living off 4%,  this is work for me, and it has worked great.  But even if you had retired in 2008,  which is about the worst possible time.  It looks like there's still what it works.  So yeah, talk everybody through this one.  Sure, well, that's what we did,  because I think that that's one of the main arguments  when you attend a bunch of five answers.  We have had unprecedented growth in the market  over this period of my since I retired in 2013.  So not discounting these ups and downs.  It's a pretty darn good chunk of time  in terms of the market going up and to the right.  So we tried to do the same exercise  and imagine a less lucky Marla who retired in 2008.  So I guess we had her retire in 2007  and start the numbers in 2008.  And so she started with the same million.  And at the end of her very first year of retiring,  her numbers had gone down to $604,000.  So if that wouldn't freak you out  as a person working on your plan, I don't know what would.  And it took a full five years for less lucky Marla  to get back up to the million dollars that she started this.  So keep in mind, so to me,  this is the most reassuring part of the story  because keep in mind, she is still withdrawing her $40,000  inflation adjusted through that whole five years  and her portfolio is growing in the background.  And so certainly at the end of her 10 years,  it's not as impressive as what my end of 10 years is  because she winds up with 1.2 million.  but that is pretty reassuring to watch your portfolio drop by 50%  and now your 10 years older,  and you're starting again with 1.2 million,  which is fantastic.  So now we plotted taking less lucky Marla  all the way up to today's date,  and it doesn't even seem possible,  but the real me at the end of 2023 had 2.26,  I think we said, and less lucky Marla  by that point in time, her portfolio has grown  to over 2.3.  Wow. So that's basically from 2008 to 2024.  Wow. Okay.  So even in a worst case scenario,  I think the point is you're retiring for the long haul.  You're not retiring for the first five years or the 10 years.  Like even a much smaller nest egg is going to still grow and catch you up over the long term.  That makes a lot of sense. So right.  Because it had recovered by 2013 in the less lucky Marla scenario.  that I think that's why the less-looking Marla actually has more money than you do today,  which is fascinating to think, right?  It is fascinating.  She retired with a million bucks, spent her 40,000 of her year.  The market went down a crazy amount and she ended up with 40% less than she started with  a year before, but stuck with it and kept withdrawing.  Like, that getting back over to a million dollars in 2013, that's not just like she sat  on the money.  She was still obviously withdrawing to live off of her year.  Yeah, I mean, it really like, I think until I looked at these real numbers with the real  inflation adjustments, instead of just sort of looking at my spending and what my big  number at the end of the year of my portfolio was, I don't think I really saw the mechanics  of how it actually works until we got prepared for this presentation.  And it was like, you know, pretty much everybody that was in the group watching the presentation,  they were pretty convinced, like once you showed them these numbers, and it was like, because  we all go through the wet if or what if the market crashes right away.  Like, do you think that's going to happen?  Like, and when we look at monetary policy and how monetary policy has changed  based on each of these, you know, worldwide financial occurrences, like, you know,  the feds of all these different countries, they move, move,  have an on earth to try to correct things and have the recovery be as quick as  possible. So, you know, they're helping us.  Yeah, well, certainly certainly seems that right there have been a lot of, uh,  a lot of significant crises in the over the last 15, 20 years.  But yeah, it is remarkable to see to see the state we're in.  And yeah, this is just really incredible to look at these numbers on paper,  even in the worst case, the less lucky Marla,  worst case scenario.  And just see it just simply works.  And yeah, it's funny because, and I love your thoughts on this, Marla,  because this again comes down to the psychology of like,  you have all these brilliant people.  Like, I'm basically just presenting this stuff.  Obviously, I'm not doing any of the research by any means.  We have all these brilliant people.  Phil Banging, who was the original creator of the 4% rule.  Obviously, there was the Trinity study.  We have people like Carson from an early retirement now  who's just running these numbers constantly.  Many, many more people that I can't name right now.  But yet, people still distrust this.  And that's like, it's hard to reconcile sometimes.  Do you think it's just fear?  I know you've thought about this a lot.  and I'd love to hear your thoughts on why that is  and how you, who've been,  you've been doing this now for 11 plus years,  it's like, how do you have that conversation with someone  who comes to you and says,  like, more of it does this work,  I'm a little afraid of this.  Yeah, it's a good question.  I have thought a lot about it  and certainly meeting all these five people on their path  and seeing people not be able to pull the plug.  I think that the strongest message I can give them is  that you know, you have to believe the numbers  and stick with your plan,  which sounds easier said than done.  But when you get to that place where you're maybe  gonna do the one where you're syndrome  and you're gonna keep trying to pad the number  and keep trying to get that 4% down to 2% or whatever.  Whatever it nonsense, as you would say,  of people like to.  I think that you just have to like hold your nose  and go with your plan because what happens is  this beautiful moment of when you now  or off the hamster wheel and you have time on your side  is this time that you have gives you the opportunity  to look around.  And I think that's been the biggest gift of size,  that you have much more time to be reading  and paying attention to world events  and watching what's going on and thinking of new ideas  and I call it scheming and dreaming.  And I think that's what helps you discover your purpose  or helps you gain confidence  that the numbers are gonna work.  Like I think that's all that I can say is,  because I remembered doing a one on one thing when Katma Stessher was virtual and there was a medical  doctor on there. And I could just tell he was like, he clearly had plenty of money and money wasn't  the thing that was stopping him from pulling the trigger and retiring. But he was filled with so  much angst and I think that that's I think the psychology is so much less about the money and so  much more about who we think we are like our identity and just these issues like we're just going  going to use excuses to not do it because it is scary.  And it's like, what am I going to do tomorrow  when that beautiful moment happens?  And I'm just alone with myself and my thoughts.  Like, you kind of have to have a plan.  But if you don't have a plan, you've now  got all kinds of time to make a plan.  So embrace that.  And it might be uncomfortable that you  are going to feel uncomfortable.  But it's worth it.  And think of all those meetings you're sitting in right now  and how terrible they are.  You don't have those anywhere.  Oh, goodness, boy.  I used to call it the poke out by eye with an iron poker meeting.  I'm like, oh, terrible.  Yeah.  Now you have time and resource freedom.  And you can do whatever you want.  I love it.  And yeah, it's funny, because that again,  feels like another kind of mic drop in the episode moment.  Because really, like, that is at the essence.  You have all this freedom now.  I mean, that's been a through line of the episode here.  It's like freedom and flexibility and just looking at these numbers and saying like,  okay, look, this actually works. This works in good years and good times and bad times as you  shown. And it just like you have been living this for more than a decade now. And you were  living your best life as anybody can tell from here and you're just an incredibly joyful person.  And you're traveling all over the place. You're scheming and dreaming constantly. You're  coming up with these amazing trips for family and friends. I know you're constantly planning these  things like you were living the beautiful five life. And it's, uh, it's just such a pleasure to see  and to be to be a friend. I just, I love it for you. That's so sweet, Brad. Thank you. And I mean,  it isn't all, you know, coins and rainbows. But the good part is that, you know, in this 10 years,  tragedy happens, terrible things happen. The same things that happen for anybody in their life,  whether they're fine or they're not fine. But five does give you the breathing space to address  those tragedies and be able to help people or family members as you need to. And like that's  the greatest gift of all. And I want to leave people with the message of your honest journey. It's  hard work. You're saving, you're probably script big and you might be sacrificing a little.  But stick with your plan. Your plan is going to work. You've run the numbers of million times.  You have this wonderful community of five people.  You can run your numbers by them.  Everyone is willing to share and talk.  You can certainly reach out to me.  I know you can reach out to Brad and stick with it  because life on the other side is so worth it.  So you've worked hard.  You do deserve it.  You're never gonna regret this decision.  So go ahead, follow your plan and live your best life.  Your best life, not the life I lead.  Lead the best life that you want to lead  when you're able to pull the trigger.  Wow, okay.  Well, that I think is a beautiful way to end this one.  Thank you so much for coming on.  I'm sure that people are gonna have questions.  So this is something we can definitely do  another followup episode on.  I think people, they're gonna be a lot of questions.  So if you're out there and you wanna send in,  we now have a new way to send in questions and feedback.  Just go to choosea.com such feedback.  And we actually have a lot of our friends  and colleagues who are amazing world class experts  responding to a lot of these questions,  which is really cool.  Marla, it's one of the neatest things I've done here  at Tuesday of I in the last eight years.  And we have people like Carson,  Bigger, and answering questions on Safer Draw.  We have Chad Carson answering questions on real estate  and Jillian John's route on many of your time  and it's on and on and on.  And Dr. Bobby and Dean Turner on Health and Fitness.  So the list goes on.  And yeah, that's where really at this point,  you can say, if you're listening to this,  sending questions, sending feedback.  I'd love to do another episode of Marla  because I feel like there are gonna be questions  on maybe more than nuts and bolts I suspect.  And just send them in.  If you have questions, if you're fierce,  like Marla is literally living this life  and she's living it just incredibly.  And she's not the only one.  Let's be entirely clear.  There are a whole host of people  who are living this five life.  Obviously, just by virtue of your consuming this content,  most likely you're still in a simulation phase.  That's just the reality.  So I think when people look at and say,  oh, nobody's actually doing this,  well, we're all still saving.  We're all still on our path to five for the most part.  But there are a lot of people like Marla,  who have been in this community for quite some time  and are living into their best lives.  And I think it's just so exciting.  We're gonna see more and more people like her  as the years go by who have saved for this time  and have now reached five.  And have pulled the trigger  and are living these incredible lives.  And I think, yeah, we need to start talking about this.  We need to start talking about what does it look like, Marla,  to live that amazing life.  What do you do?  You're like you said, there is some nervousness  that first day, because you maybe you did have  some identity wrapped up in this.  But like you said, I mean, and I'll throw this back to you  even though I said I was gonna close it up.  It's like, yeah, like you worked in a job for 15 years.  And I imagine to flip that switch off  is not the easiest thing to just turn it off forever.  But what did those first couple of months look like for you?  I know it's a while. It's probably 11 and a half years ago this month.  For me, it was more than the first few months because unlike I think most of the people who are in the  Phi community now, I didn't have a plan so I really just like,  ostentatiously pulled the trigger and I didn't really know what I was signing up for.  So I think my doubts and fears were more extreme, hopefully than what most people would have.  So yeah, I think I was in a really like a lot of things about, you know,  whether I was deserving of this type of life and really feeling sort of if I didn't feel  overtly judged, I felt judged by myself that in my wasting my best earning years and  in my you know if I wasn't using my time really well like who's the judge of how you're using  your time well but I was really down on myself about that so I think it did take me a number of  years to kind of get past that and feel like you know what I'm doing the best that I can and  every year I'm getting better at this and every year I'm having more fun and giving myself permission  to just say, I can just have a fun life. There's nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that at all. And yeah, to your point, you hit-fi and pulled the trigger back  in the early days, right? The 2013 era of the fire movement or fire community. And yeah,  I think a lot of us have realized because we've heard some cautionary tales of people who  had this existential crisis when they pulled the trigger or because they were just shooting for a  number on a screen and they didn't think about life afterwards, right? They were running away from  something instead of running towards a great life. And I think hopefully we've all realized like  this is not just about the digits on the screen. It's about maybe during those years along the  journey now, trying to figure out, hey, what do I want my life to look like? And again, we've had  Jillian talk about many retirements. We've had just from the fine years to talk about the cure for  for the boring middle and it's experimentation, right?  And you need to figure out like,  what do I actually wanna do with my life?  And yeah, I mean, I think this stuff is really important.  And I love, I think, Marla, to me,  that's what's so cool about our community is like,  we're all learning together and we're learning  from the people who came before us who have realized like,  okay, I did all these things great,  but maybe in these couple things,  if I could have done it all over again,  I would have done it a little differently.  And I think that's the beautiful part  about being in this worldwide community.  I agree.  You know, I didn't have a lot of peers at the time that we're already retired, but we all  have a lot of peers now.  And so being in the community and having all these resources is really going to help you.  And if you are stuck, if you're working, I think the saddest stories I hear are the people  who are working so hard and they're like, but I don't have a purpose.  I don't have something to retire to.  And they think they need to have that all figured out.  If you don't have that figured out, it's still okay.  You can still pull the trigger and you can have the time on the other side to start working  on your plan.  I can guarantee you when you don't have an alarm going off in the morning and you pop  out a bed with joy and no dread, no Sunday scaries, you're going to be much more prepared  to start planning the next chapter.  Well, you've been there and done that.  I really appreciate you coming on, Marla.  This is fun.  Yeah, I'm very serious.  I'd love to have you back on.  Please, anybody listening, sending questions, let us know what you want to talk tomorrow  about because I think this is really, really important as we all move along the path on our  five journey.

We are back with another episode of the talking lead podcast. I'm your host lefty  Where we have been  LEDUCATING the unlegicated since 2012  13 years of bringing you guys good wholesome fun  education or entertainment  Whatever you call it, excitement baby.  And today is no different.  We have a returning guest.  His last appearance been, I guess over five years ago.  But we are glad to have him back.  Ladies and gentlemen, give a good warm lead head welcome to Kyle Mills.  Kyle, welcome in.  Now thanks for having me.  Yes sir, yes sir.  We're glad to have you back.  Last time we had you on, we reviewed your book.  Was it, it was Vince Flynn.  You were doing the Vince Flynn novels then.  I can't remember which one it was.  Yeah, I can either.  Well, you were kind of the middle of my 10 year doing  the Mitch Rapp books.  Yeah. Yeah. So I think that was like episode 347.  If you guys want to go back, check that out.  Listen to that.  But Mitch is number one New York Times best selling author and he's got dozens and dozens of books under his belt and  He had one almost 20 years ago. I guess it's been you had this this character called fade and you have resurrected fade and  in your new book  Fade in is this the second in that series?  Nah, not really the new fade in which just published is really the first in the series  The other book like you said, I wrote 20 years ago if you went back and read it  It would feel like kind of a prequel from a younger days  Yeah, yeah, so I guess I mean I guess you kind of had to do that when you brought him back is it's kind of make that more of a  like a flashback to his younger years, I guess.  Yeah, you know, 20 years is a long time.  And it's a long time.  It's a long time.  And nowadays, you know, where everything changes,  it's funny, that's the first book of mine I've ever read.  Like I've never gone back and read one of my books,  but it's funny to read because, you know,  the internet was sort of fledgling  and people were buying stuff from the sharper image.  There was no amount of money on or anything.  So it's funny how quickly books become historical fiction.  Yeah.  And we're going to talk about his new book.  But before we do that, I mean, last time that we had you on, and we  were kind of in the midst of the the COVID pandemic.  If you, if you want to call it that, but there was a lot going on with  you, you were kind of in between Wyoming and Spain at the time and you were kind of, you know,  iffy on whether you'd be able to get back to Spain and we were talking a little bit  prior to the show and it looks like you got things worked out and you might be headed back, huh?  Yeah, well that was touch and go. I remember my residency was running out in like one week  which couldn't fly to Spain, and they opened it up for residents.  So we moved all of a sudden, drove down there  in a rental car, put all our stuff in storage,  rented our house and Wyoming out, and we had to get  COVID tests in the parking lot of some building,  or near the airport, and if we had tested positive,  we couldn't have gotten on the plane and we had nowhere to live.  We basically got a rental car and a couple of duffled bags.  Fortunately, we both tested negative and managed  to get on that flight, which was, but it was weird.  It was like, you'd go to the bar salon airport  and it was empty.  Like nothing was open.  It was just like, it was just us.  Like you had the whole city to yourself.  Yeah.  And Spain had been locked down.  They'd quarantine themselves and all this stuff.  So it was, it was a,  It was a crazy time, particularly in Spain.  Yeah.  And bringing that up because we're going to get into that  in your new book.  But we'll hit on that in a minute.  As far as that pandemic goes that we all live through  and most everybody survived, looking back  hindsight on that and reflecting, as your opinion  changed on that. Did you learn anything new? What did you get from where we are?  From where we were then to where we are now on that?  Yeah, I would say probably the most interesting thing about it was that I really thought  that the world would have systems in place after SARS and everything that would have systems  in place that were pretty solid for doing that, for mitigating the problems,  communicating with society.  And that was, I was, I think overly optimistic  on that.  I felt, it felt a little haphazard  and other than Operation Warp Speed,  which seemed to chug along pretty well,  it just seemed a little chaotic.  More so than I would have thought with CDC and WHO,  you know, ostensibly doing this every day.  Right? Yeah. And that seems to be like a big mystery to everybody.  It's like, this isn't our first rodeo.  And in comparison, it wasn't as bad of an epidemic as we've had in the past times.  And like you said, the communication between the inter-agencies,  And then also just governmental, you know,  back and forth and politicizing it  and using it as a weapon to, you know,  to come over to our side  because this is how we do things and how we see it.  And then also countries,  because the whole world was going through this.  And just the lack of communication,  it seemed like even through the different countries,  you know, because everybody wanted to do things  their own way.  Yeah, and some countries got hit much harder  than others, Spain was hit really hard, really early in it.  And I mean, they're, they actually have a huge medical capacity.  They're more beds per capita than the United States even.  And, but they also have a very old population.  So they were just getting hammered.  Their hospitals were filling up.  People were dying left and right.  And ended up quarantining,  We were like having a pretty harsh quarantine.  Fortunately, I was not there for that.  So it was, yeah, the reactions were different  all over the world.  It's Scandinavia reacted in a very different way.  The United States went state by state really.  I mean, I'm from Wyoming.  So we got off the ELSI.  There's no people here.  So yeah, I mean, we were all pretty spread out.  You can kind of do whatever you wanted.  So it was an interesting time to see it.  to see it and I, you know, my fear now is that we didn't learn anything.  Um, and do we ever?  Yeah.  I mean, this is a little bit what Fade in is about.  It talks about how the governments are getting crazier and more incompetent.  And so they're good at like screaming about partisan stuff and, and, and trying to get  reelected.  They're very good at getting reelected.  But if something major happens and it's really is a real crisis and lives are at  stake, they get a little wandering at that point. All they know about is how to use it to try to get,  you know, re-elected or to get people around.  Exactly.  To keep the power.  Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, things when things got me, I think about even Texas, yeah,  I followed their power shortage. And there were power outage a few years ago because I had  written a book very similar to that called Total Power in the Metrap series. And as  That's the one we talked about.  That's the...  Oh, is it?  Okay.  And so about a terrorist group attacking America's power grid.  And I remember watching Texas, you know,  they're trying to blame the windmills and then doing this.  And now it's, and you know, saying windmills don't work  when it's cold, which is pretty funny if you're from Wyoming  because the Texans don't even understand what cold is.  Their cold snap was like our nice spring day.  And it all just gave, then nothing happened.  They like, they didn't do anything about it,  so it's just good happen again.  So it's an interesting time to be alive  because there are a lot of crazy crises.  I mean, not only war with Hamas or with Russia,  but also power grid failures.  You've got storms, it burns in the west where I am  and floods in the east.  And no, it really does anything about it.  think for us as the like the US military would have the capacity to spot wildfires and put them out.  We have a thing called satellites. Yeah,  planes. I mean, don't have spy planes. We're not doing much with those. Fly around. I mean, the drones  the drone take down water these days.  But that's how to do it. Does that get you reelected? Maybe not. Maybe that's the calculation.  like, I, fire, you know, doesn't get neither getting near either here nor there to me getting  reelected. So not going to worry about it. I have to present this, you know, this, this, this  need, you need me. You can't survive without me. So, you know, if they solve all the problems,  then they're not going to be needed anymore. Exactly. And it may be just maybe you create more.  I don't know. I think of Russia attacking Ukraine. Well, it's just create some problems and  that I can take over and solve them.  There are conspiracy theories about that.  I wrote a book about that too,  a few years ago, Russian,  dating its neighbors, which book was that?  Red War.  Fortunately, I got it out there before they actually did it.  Maybe you gave them the idea.  Maybe it's fault, Kyle.  Maybe I did it, it might be my fault.  I've given a lot of people a lot of ideas apparently ever.  Well, we kind of question that on the last interview.  It seems like, and I say you guys, you thriller, especially, you know, the military, governmental,  political thrillers.  You guys seem to have an insight because, like you said, my book was out before that happened  and then it happened.  same thing with the pandemic. There were several people that were talking about this virus thing and  doing books about it. And then, you know, it seems like all of a sudden boom that that happened.  War with, like you said, Russia or Ukraine. This is uncanny. It's like you guys have a little crystal  ball that you can look into. I mean, that's what you're always thinking about, right? And what's  the next threat and how could it happen and all these things.  But truth is now the world's getting so crazy.  I mean, like for instance, Redmore, I wrote about Russia attacking its neighbors.  But when I researched it, so I do deep dives into this stuff, which is what's fun about  it for me.  I could not put together any reason, any rational reason that Russia would attack its neighbors.  The truth is based on my research, the Russian military has always been wildly overrated.  Their economy is not particularly strong, etc., etc.  And they're the largest country in the world by land mass,  the, and a fairly small population.  The one thing they don't need is more land.  And so I gave the guy a brain tumor.  Like, that was the really, the only way I could think I could come up with.  That really, he was weak and the leader was weak.  And it was really more worried about the people around him taking him out to, to take over.  And so this was more of a distraction.  And then Putin goes out and does it and it has played out exactly the way I envisioned  that it was just a disaster for them.  It's a disaster for Ukraine.  They gain nothing.  They've losing people hand over fist.  They have a plummeting population.  And now they're killing all their young men.  So you can't predict anymore how nuts people are going to be.  Yeah, then we've got the Israel-Iran Hamas debacle going on as well.  Yeah, they're even crazier.  Hamas attacking Israel is like me going into a barn slapping Mike Tyson.  Like, you knew exactly how that was going to end.  Right.  Yeah, they did it anyway. I mean supposedly and again, there's conspiracy theories going on  You know with that as well. There's always conspiracy and I like  That's what I do for a living.

It's just called fade, wasn't it?  Right.  but just getting into this one and picking it up,  I felt like I didn't really miss anything.  I mean, I'm sure I did and I need to go back and read that.  But it was easy for me just to jump into this and pick up  after 20 years and move forward with this book.  And I really enjoyed it.  It was a good book.  I like the guy who does your readings.  Oh, yeah, well.  Yeah, he does a good job.  But it's kind of a pet peeve for me  when guys do female voices.  It just kind of takes me out of it.  It's like, I wish sometimes they do multiple readers.  I've never had a book done like that.  That's what I'm, they're kind of interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah. And that's, I think it was you and I that tell you,  is there you and me or Jack that talked about that?  It's like, why don't they get like a sign rolls to people?  is like, they have it.  And I'm sure it's all about the money.  It's more expensive.  Twice as expensive, probably.  Yeah, probably.  Or it's probably much harder.  I think we do have to sit in the same room.  A lot of these guys sit in their closet.  You know, surrounded by their clothes.  So it sounds good.  Today's the crayon.  That's incredible.  They're going to go in their closet.  Now you got two people in your closet.  That seems a little weird.  You know?  Well, they have studios for these things.  A lot of them do now.  But I remember, you know, they just sat in their little tiny room with its all sound, you  know, optimized and all that.  Really, really quiet.  Yeah.  Um, but other than that, you know, and that, that's not just your, that's any book that  I listened to or not.  I'm not even able to.  Yeah.  When the, the guy goes into the female voices, but he did good on a couple of them.  I mean, actually, I could, I could throw a lot at that poor guy.  Yeah, he was laughing at him about it because he's got everything for all different accents,  a lot of female characters.  He's got cartoon characters.  He had to do like Marvin the Martian and Yosemite saying, yeah, I was like, I'm going to  make your earn your money.  And that's a part of the book that I wanted to talk to you about.  So when we get to that, I want to remind me about that because it was good.  I liked the way that you did that.  But I want to catch up with you, because like I said,  it's been over five years since we talked last.  And the pandemic and all this stuff.  And you had to go back and forth from here to Spain.  And you had a lot going on in your life.  Yeah.  And you were doing the, you took out, well,  you didn't take over, but you, the Vince Flynn books,  that was kind of your main gig.  And then, again, I don't know, for whatever reason,  Don Bentley is doing those now.  And we had Don on, was it last year?  He's been about a year when we had probably  was because his next book doesn't come out  until the end of September.  OK.  It was last year's first one.  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah.  And then that was kind of a mix up,  because you said you're going to send me your book.  and this one came and I was like,  I think they got, you guys mixed up  and sent me the wrong book.  Because, oh right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  I didn't even know I was getting this book,  but I guess Dan figured I needed to have that my arsenal.  Yeah, absolutely.  But I know you and Don are good buddies,  you're good friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Guys have done some shows together  and interviews and things like that.  How does that work with you guys when like you were doing that you did?  How did you do like nine nine? Okay  Did nine of those how does that handoff work?  When you know you've you've been doing it for so long and then they bring in a new guy do you guys?  Do you kind of like do a debrief or?  You know anything like that or how's that? Yeah, I mean to some extent for sure  I mean I know Don for a long time already. I was really excited that they  I chose him after I left.  That was a perfect guy to do it.  Yeah, I mean, we talked a little bit about  where he was gonna go with the book.  And I tried to leave it.  I kind of consciously left the last book,  feeling very much like the end of my arc.  You know, I'd kind of taken Mitch  when he was very angry and frustrated and alone.  And I took him through nine books at the end.  You know, he dealt with a lot of stuff.  He had essentially a partner and kind of a daughter.  It was in a better place.  And I left there.  I killed off a couple of complicated characters.  And I felt like, okay, now Don, I've left you  in a really good place.  You can go anywhere you want with this book  or with the next arc in the series.  So, and then, you know, everyone's  and while we talk about little details,  like, you know, how old is some character or something?  those calculations are really hard to make and I made them when I took over. Because I read through  the whole series again and like took meticulous notes and made all these calculations and stuff.  And then obviously expanded the universe significantly over another nine books.  So every once in a while we'll chitchat about details if he can't remember what I had done in some book  or whatever. Right. Now the fade is an original character to you. Yes. Yeah. So, so lead  hands in my previous episode, I was letting them know that you were coming on. I had misspoke  and thought it was one of Vince Flynn's characters that you were expounding on. And I was wrong  about that, and I'm sorry. I just want to clear that up with our listeners, make sure they understand.  But with, again, when you're handing stuff off and is there like notice, how much notice  do you get?  It's like, okay, you know, you got two more books and then we're going to hand it off  or do you even get that kind of courtesy?  Oh, I left.  So yeah, it wasn't, I gave them a bunch of notice.  Yeah.  So however, yeah, that worked.  Yeah.  I gave probably a year and a half or so.  I think probably when I started my last book,  which was the last book on that contract,  I called them and told them that it would be my last book.  So that gave them more than a year to find somebody  because it's not that easy.  People have, they have contractual obligations.  And then they asked me who I thought  might be a good choice to replace me.  And hilariously, I did not choose Don, but I didn't even mention Don because he had just  gotten to number two on the New York Times bestseller list with a Clancy book.  So I didn't think he'd be interested.  And then shortly thereafter, he and I had dinner.  We're having dinner together and he asked me if I was going to continue the mid-trap  series, but it did not been announced that I wasn't.  So I told him I was and unbeknownst to me,  he had been asked to take it over.  And so he lied to him about that, he lied to me.  And then that he wrote you for Paul this agent.  And he's like, oh my God, they're firing Kyle  and they're not even telling him,  I don't want the job.  Like I'm not taking it.  And he's like his agent said,  well, let me call and see what's up.  And they said, no, Kyle laughed,  he can help us do not as long as he wants.  You're protecting each other's feelings.  Yeah, and then he, he, he, he, or he called me the next day and he's like,  I can't believe you lied to me all night.  He's like, well, you lied to me too.  Exactly.  It goes hand in hand.  Now, now knowing at this point, knowing this, is he like, is he like making any requests  from you?  He was like, hey, would you kill this guy off?  So I don't have to continue that.  No, no, no, I had been really careful about that.  like I told him, I'm gonna leave you in a primo spot  to, you know, I'm gonna finish up this arc,  I'm gonna tie everything up in a nice bow,  and then you can go, you know,  wherever you want with Metrap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of an interesting dynamic, you know,  with when you get into the situation,  like Vince Flynn and, you know, him passing  and then bringing other people on to carry the torch.  And yeah, it's a little, you know,  little different than, you know,  somebody that just,  same person does it throughout their entire life,  you know, kind of deal.  Like Steve, you know, Stephen Hunter  with his character.  I think it's an interest.  It's definitely interesting.  I mean, obviously Vince is an amazing writer  and created this amazing series and character.  You know, on the other hand,  it's kind of interesting to see  different perspectives people have on the character in the series. I mean, I brought things that were,  I mean, I tried to stay very true to Vince's style, but I brought things like humor  to it that he had not done. I had moved it away a little bit from just doing Islamic terrorism  into doing other types of threats. And then Don, particularly if you read his first book,  He brings his military background to it, which I don't have.  So I don't write. My background is more having grown up around a lot of CIA, FBI type people.  So I'm not being like an espionage kind of.  Yeah, I'm more of a CIA intelligence. That's my kind of my knowledge and my comfort space,  Whereas Don has a lot of knowledge about the military.  So he can bring that to the book with authenticity that I don't think I could have.  Just to imagine if you guys teamed up.  It'd be fun.  Right?  I've never done it, but I've talked about it with authors before, but never pulled the trigger.  Yeah. It kind of reminds me of like the Star Trek like Trekkies and how they've, you know,  the fans themselves have kind of gone and written their own scripts and how, you know,  they like stories done and told them with AI nowadays, you know, they're actually going and filming,  you know, some of this stuff on their own. And, you know, and the studios are taking notice,  It's just like these guys are doing a better job  than what we were doing.  That's gonna be really interesting to see,  because I don't know, maybe when I retire,  I'll get into filmmaking,  because by then AI will be ready to do it,  and they've been a couple of weeks.  It ain't terribly fun with.  Yeah, I'd be fun to do a couple of my books,  right, I learned to write scripts  and learned to film this stuff.  And I think there's gonna be,  you know, there's a huge indie book, you know, market now,  which kind of rose up because of the invention of, you know, e-books and the Kindle.  And then now I foresee a huge indie movie industry rising up.  And just like the indie books, there's some amazing indie books out there now.  And that have not gotten a mainstream publisher for whatever reason.  I think they're gonna be amazing indie films as people particularly I think even much more so than books because  The bears to entry into a book are not that high. You know by a typewriter get some paper, right?  but the  bears to entry to filming a movie have always been  You know insurmountably high so  So now you lower that barrier, they're going to be all kinds of people with insane talent.  Yeah, now you need to.  So that never wanted to go to Hollywood or like get into that quagmire, but have the incredible  talent to actually produce amazing stuff.  Yeah.  And the reason I brought that up is, you know, I Pete, you get into, you know, that territory  of, you know, these fans are just doing, you know, they think they're doing an homage  to their heroes, their favorite, whether it's Star Trek or whatever it may be.  But then the studios see that in a different way with their attorneys and they're like,  hey, you guys are still in our stuff and you're getting the whole other bottle of wax.  I was just with books, do you see that happen at all?  where, yeah, I wrote this little spinoff of fate or whoever it may be.  And they put it out there on the internet.  It sort of depends.  I mean, fan fiction, I think, has been pretty well tolerated to some extent.  But it also depends on the author.  I remember we were our little local library here in my tiny town and Wyoming was doing  like a Halloween thing for the kids that was a Harry Potter  themed and they got a cease and desist order  from JK Rowling's people.  This you live in Jacksonville?  Oh, she's British.  Oh, well, I mean, I don't know how they found out about it,  but they did, they're scouring the internet  for anything like that.  So I think that it will be a big thing.  But one of the things I'm just super interested in  is the idea that you'd have some really interesting directors out there who could, if I wanted to write a script of one of my books or one of, you know, my friends who's a novelist or whatever kind of novel.  Yeah.  You know, particularly like fantasy, which is huge, but very expensive to film that we would be able to connect with people like that and have a movie made for, what?  25 grand or something instead of you know, 10, you know, 10.5 million or she  hardly in. Well, they have like these crowd funding, you know, things now too,  where you know, it's like, hey, if you went out to your fan base and said, hey,  we're gonna make a movie, you know, on this book, you know, you would get, yeah,  get the fan support and they have like a little input and there's this, you  probably familiar with them. It's called Angel Studios. I can't remember exactly what I think  it's called Angel Studios. But that's kind of how that studio works is it's it's crowdfunded  and they take input from the people that are donating or you know, doing whatever and then they'll  make a movie on that.  This is our idea, you guys want to get behind it.  And then they'll put their names in the credits and everybody that helped donate and do  all that.  It's super fun.  I mean, it'd be really interesting because I mean, Jeff Curtis, studios put some serious  crap out.  I'm pretty sure I can do better than some of the stuff I've seen on Netflix.  Yeah.  So, Kirkham is an author and he's done like a post-apocalyptic kind of book series.  And Angel Studios took his book and they've done a couple of movies and then like a TV series  kind of thing.  You know, it's interesting how they're doing that.  Yeah, it'll be really cool.  There were eventually just like books that'll be so much content that the hard part  will be sifting through it. You know, separating the gems from all the garbage.  Because unfortunately, I feel like that's the way the internet is going to some extent.  Pretty soon it's just going to be BS, rage and porn. And that's like all that's going to be  all left on it. Yeah. Well, I got a little more faith. I need some optimists.  So let's get into the book.  And then, because I want to circle back to the movie aspect, but I want to cover the book  first.  So this is, again, like the second book in this series, maybe it's the first, but it's  the first book in the series, but there is a prequel.  You're like Star Wars.  You know, they did their prequel.  Or even the Bitz one series.  wrote a bunch of books and then he went back with American assassin and explored, you know,  his origin, mid traps origin story. Yeah. So this is about a Navy SEAL former Navy SEAL  who's gotten in with the CIA or, you know, other government agency. And he's got some issues,  I guess to save the least.  And that's where I wanted to get in, you know, when we get to that part about Daffy Duck and  all that. But kind of take us in and I don't want to give a lot of spoilers, but we will do some  spoilers on here because the book is out. It's been out for about a month now, and it a couple weeks.  A couple weeks. Yeah. Yeah, a couple of weeks. So we won't do a lot of spoilers, but we'll  Well, amp it up.  You know, get you guys interested.  It's Kyle Mills, fade in, and fade is the main character.  So tell us about the non-spoiler version of this.  Yeah.  So fade is, his real name is Sala Malphayed, and his parents were first generation immigrants  from Syria.  He was born in the US and New York.  And he became an ABCL and his teammates found, so I'm all if I had to be kind of a mouthful  so they nicknamed him Fade and it's stuck.  He then went to work for the CIA, but kind of got screwed over.  He got shot in the back and he was, the bullet was paralyzing him and they did not give  him really much medical support.  And so that's kind of where you found him in the first book.  They tried to, a hormone security,  tried to force him back into service,  to sort of use him up until he became paralyzed,  and he went on a bit of a rampage against them  with the idea that he would die at the end of it.  And so that then he brings it back here.  Or that brings it back to this book,  where he comes out of his coma  and he is put in a position where,  I mean, he's kind of lost.  He's wanted by the police.  He's woken up from this coma and he has offered basically rehabilitation by this billionaire  who then wants him to consider coming and work for him.  That's a pretty good synopsis.  And then the action ensues.  It does.  Yeah.  So this billionaire named John Lowe basically goes back to what we were talking about earlier.  He sees the governments of the world failing.  They're becoming increasingly autocratic.  They're becoming increasingly wrapped up simply  and maintaining their own power.  They have no interest in really solving problems,  maybe even interested in creating them  to maintain fear and chaos so they can stay in power.  And Lowe sees this as incredibly dangerous.  He sees his billionaire classes becoming hyper powerful.  You know, if you think about Elon Musk,  I wrote this book before Elon Musk out into politics,  but think about a guy who we can barely communicate  without his satellites.  We can't shoot stuff into space without his rockets.  You think about social media clean energy.  Yeah, they feed us everything we see by an algorithm.  They can show us or not show us anything they want.  They control everything that we see and think.  And so he sees this as becoming very dangerous  and is going to lead to societal collapse.  So he's trying to bring together some of these billionaires  and number of politicians into a group  that understands that if you have 250 billion making  another billion isn't that important,  but sort of slowing things down  and being more thoughtful about things  and controlling the rate of change  so that we don't collapse human society  might be in everybody's best interest.  But how do you do that?  And it's not easy.  And one of the problems is sometimes there's no substitute  in a situation like that for killing someone.  And that's Fades area of expertise.  So he also wants to create a small,  very, very talented high-end paramilitary capability.  And that's where Fade comes in.  Now this guy kinda reminds me of what people,  when they say Illuminati,  You know, the illuminati. It seems like low, you know, that's his group of people.  They are the illuminati. They control the truth.  Yeah, I mean, they have unbelievable amount of power.  You know, I mean, just, but this is real life. I mean, I'm not telling you anything,  if you get like Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and those guys all in a room,  that's a lot of the world's power right there.  And depending on how they want to utilize it,  it can have a lot of major effects on.  And even them, it seems like they've got puppet masters  and they're not the real behind the curtain people.  To me, it doesn't seem that way.  It seems like there's still somebody even deeper  than Elon or Zuckerberg or any of these guys.  It's dark or...  I mean, even the politics.  I mean, those guys have been more willing to take a knee  to the American president that I honestly thought they would be.  It seems like, you know, there's the old saying, fuck you money.  Yeah. I feel like by $250 billion,  I don't want to listen to anybody.  I wouldn't take anybody's calls.  Yeah. That's kind of just a little.  Oh, yeah.  But, so yeah.  And so I think we're seeing this.  And we're seeing it with AI now,  which is kind of crazy if you think about  when I started this book, writing it,  I wasn't really even a thing.  Now it's years ago.  Yeah, it was a couple of years ago.  And so their ability to target us, say on social media, has expanded like a thousand  fold just over the last few months.  Now instead of saying, I mean, they already know everything about us, right?  This is unprecedented.  Even when you think about the stasi in Eastern Europe.  I mean, they knew a lot about you, but it was a couple of guys hiding in your attic with  real to real tape and a pen and a piece of paper with headphones on, right?  Okay.  These guys are everything you think, everything you talk to all your friends, everything  where you've been, everything you've ever bought, all these things.  And now with AI, they can use that to profile you.  Not like they used to.  I mean, they used to profile me as, you know, white guy, almost 60 lives in Wyoming, right?  And I'm going to mark it to him or I'm going to try to convince him of something.  The sell them.  So I think no, everything.  They can just take me put it into a psychological, you know, algorithm and say,  how do I market to Kyle Mills?  Yeah.  And they can do that for everybody in the world.  So it's not selling anymore.  It's controlling.  It's controlling.  Absolutely.  It's that was maybe how it started off.  is like, hey, we can increase our revenue  because we can target this guy's likes.  But now we can control this guy  to do what we want also.  Here's what you're gonna think, right?  And we're gonna hide everything from you  that would make you think differently.  And they've tried this,  they've been psychological tests and it works.  So this is something that even during,  you know, they think about back in the day  when the royalty was all powerful.  I think 400 years ago were something,  they couldn't control what the average person saw and did.  I mean, heck, what could they do?  Stick something to a tree that they wrote on,  but you couldn't read, so it didn't really matter to you.  But it's eight hours a day, man, at least.  You're staring at that screen  and whatever they're feeding you.  Yeah, through this screen or it's this screen mainly,  and this is the, they record you, they track you.  like you said, they know everywhere you're going,  who you've been with, because they can triangulate  and know that that person's phones are here.  It's, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Everybody you associate with, everything you're,  people you're near.  And I mean, I'm already seeing this.  It's really interesting.  So when you put a book out, you get all this spam  from people, you know, their scams.  I think they're like, oh, sign up with us.  will publicize your book to our many, many subscribers.  And, but it was always like deer, and there'd be like Kyle Mills in a different font or whatever.  We will, you know, they're always like misspellings and shit. And so now it's in Christ.  So I know I'd get one of those a week. Now, one a day, but there a deer Kyle, oh my God, I just  finished fade in and sell out my faiet is such an amazing character. It goes on and you're background  with your father being the director of Interpol and CIA and all this stuff.  And it was just what our subscribers are looking for.  This was all written by an AI that scoured the description of the book and my  thing. So they are targeting me personally in this beautifully written way  to convince me to pay them to do nothing other than probably try to get into my  bank accounts and siphoned them all off the North Korea.  So, but that's going to be everything now.  just constant personalized appeals from scammers and politicians and everything.  And you're not going to be able to tell, even if you respond to it,  they will respond to you. You'll have no idea. Unless you sit down face to face with somebody,  you have no idea what you're dealing with or who you're dealing with.  So I just pulled up Grok and I typed in,  And if you were to interview Kyle, what would you ask him?  Be creative and original.  And then it goes through, and it gives me a list here.  Yeah.  These questions aim to surprise Mills,  engage the lead head brigade and uncover fresh perspectives  on fade in in writing process and personal influences.  It's kind of terrifying.  And I think also humans, this is something my character John Lowe is sort of wrestling with,  we are willing much more than you would think to see that power to politicians, to the wealthy  and to computers.  I mean, it's amazing.  Think about, I mean, just how much will it date and including your irises and all that  are you willing to give to clear a private company that they're going to use your data  in all kinds of ways just to cut the line at the airport?  Yeah, I'll give all that up.  Yeah.  Because so we're willing to, and that's what we're doing.  I mean, as soon as governments or private companies get power over us, they never give  it up.  That never goes away, right?  The Patriot Act, it comes into power and then it never goes away.  just that creep of every year, they have a little bit more on us, a little bit more power  over us, right? And it never goes away. So this is what it came up with. My me just typing  that in. There you go. I actually never really use AI. It's funny.  I was going to ask you, I'm going to have to try more. It's fun. It is. It's very cool.  The thing is though, I think for me what I love about my job is writing books.  So people will tell you, oh, you can write AI, I'll write this for you.  In fact, it pops up now.  It's super annoying on Microsoft Word.  It's like AI assistant and it's always like tracking down the margin.  And I go, this is what I like to do.  I don't want AI to do it for me.  It's my favorite part of the job sitting down and creating these worlds  and these characters and stuff.  And the idea that AI would do it for me,  I just find it's fun to try to like deep dive with it.  Once you get it past its initial like canned answer stuff  and then you try to, you know,  you go into deep dive and you know,  it's fun to see, you know,  some of the things that they come up with.  Now, it did get this for us,  says this is your third fade novel.  It's because it's getting it off Amazon and Amazon has it written wrong.  Something gets into Amazon, you can never get it out.  I see.  So I think the book I wrote called the second horseman has fade in it, but it's not true.  Let's see what this, let's ask one of its questions says reviving fade after 20 years.  Fades at one of a kind character.  Is he a thief?  I don't know.  So he's definitely not a, he's a bit of an unrepent mass murderer, maybe.  He's a dark, he's a funny guy.  He's a philosophical guy.  And I wanted to resurrect him because we live in a weird world.  Like it's not, he has the same skills as Mitrap.  But Mitrap was very much about good and evil, right?  He had typically a, he had a terrorist coming after him that guy was bad.  The Metrop is good, love to America, all these things.  Fade is dealing with this weird shit, the margins.  Like, what is AI going to take over?  Are these countries going to start these wars?  Or is America going to collapse under the weight of its own animosity between the two parties  that most of which isn't even real?  So these are the questions that I wanted to deal with.  these modern questions because the truth is,  Russia is never going to invade us.  Neither is China, we're uninvatable.  The Muslims are never gonna take us down.  They're not very good fighters.  They can't get here in large numbers.  What's the threat to us?  So is much grander.  It's this runaway technology.  It's our own animosity.  It's really maybe even existential.  the idea that I mean, think back on when the when computer first beat our humans best chess  player, people really freaked out. That was what we do, right? You know, we and now what  you're going to find out is the thing that we see is making us special. We're smarter than  whatever the average bear literally other creatures, yeah, special place in the universe.  We're just dim went we're pretty dim-witted.  AYA is going to be much smarter.  And so what is our place in the universe then?  Who are we?  What do we do other than sort of breathe air  and suck up resources and drop dead eventually?  And I think that's a thing that's going to be hard for us  to deal with them.  What if AI does take over their ideas  that it could create a separate economy?  So this robot and AI economy will take care of everything  for us way better than we ever could.  And then just pay us to suck up there.  They'll have the economy and we'll get a check every month  just for being born.  Like what do we do then?  One of the truth is, idle hands are the devil's work.  What you don't want in the world is a bunch of young men  with access to weapons and nothing to do.  Because that's gonna go very badly.  Well, I mean, it kind of goes into the Terminator,  scan it, yeah.  And I don't think it's gonna be like that.  I mean, people worry about AI becoming sentient.  That's not why these sentient works.  And it, but what it can do is take everything,  but it's almost more dangerous.  Just take everything from us that we need,  like our sense of purpose,  our sense of superiority, our jobs,  You know, a reason to get up in the morning, right?  I mean, all this, if it can all be done better than AI.  I mean, and then the answer to your question is,  what's our purpose?  Yeah.  What's the meaning of life?  People have been contemplating this for thousands  or whatever.  Yeah.  Since the beginning.  And it was served God for very long time still  is for the Muslims much less than the West.  Yeah.  I don't know that that's what people would say.  Or maybe it's your job.  like I build whatever, I build cars, people need cars,  I'm a doctor, I heal people.  Well, once all that's gone, family, family could be family,  people are having fewer and fewer children.  In America, all over the world, really,  I'm even in Latin America, Russia's collapsing,  their China's population's collapsing, Europe's.  So why not some of this?  Do you think that's something that's maybe been,  so bloomily instilled in us, you know, because that's why, you know, one of the, um,  conspiracy theories on the pandemic was just to thin out the population, you know, the  aluminum wants to, you know, 500 million people total, you know, whatever.  As a person with no children, I think that we can either, yeah, that people just realized,  wow, kids are expensive time consuming and kind of sticky.  And women, as they have had, women had no choice, even when I was born, really.  I mean, you know, now you have contraception and women have equal ability to go into the  job market.  And I think that's all it is all over the world is that you know what you would call it.  What's up?  I've heard it called selfishness.  It's like, you know, you're just, you're just, you're just, I don't know.  You don't want to have kids because then you've got to, you know, dedicate time, money, effort, you know, to them.  I hate the idea of selfishness though because I have a lot of people have children because they really, really want them.  It's not to like help out society.  Like people don't say, geez, I think the world needs another kid.  I don't want one, but I'm going to do it for the planet.  You know, people either want kids or they don't.  And I think a lot of people probably want lower numbers than they women had, you know, before contraception say.  My brain had an ability to grow families.  They had five plus kids on each.  And now women have jobs and other things to perceive.  So I think that's kind of inevitable.  But I mean, also, this had to stop.  I mean, the population's pleasure is interesting in that in my lifetime,  the population of the world is more than doubled just in my lifetime.  And that's kind of incredible.  I don't think that was a sustainable pay.  So it's gonna level off and it starts to decline,  which will be interesting because nobody's ever handled that  before it extends maybe the black death.  Like how do you, which is the pay,  who knows what's that?  I'd say who knows, 1,000, 100,000 to 1,000 to years.  I mean, there could have been a simulation  that evolved just like us.  And giant out.  You know, I mean, this supposedly this, you know,  this planet, this universe has been here  for millions and millions of years.  So, and we've just reached our evolution  over the past, what, 2000 years?  Yeah, I mean, I certainly modern societies  like yeah, the Romans, I guess the Greeks.  Yeah, I'm starting to what we think  of as modern society.  Right. And if you look at the overall time frame of that,  This could have happened several times.  Yeah.  What is that?  There's some name for that theory,  the Salirian theory or something.  That's what it is.  Yeah, it's something like that.  I got it wrong, but it's close to that.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it certainly could have happened.  So we'll see what happens with that arc.  Well, it also did not go crazy  would be a good thing.  Yeah, this is a matrix.  We're living in the matrix right now.  We are programs.  Somebody outside control in this.  And could be everything's a simulation simulation.  Yeah.  And that's that.  And the reason I bring that up is that's kind of the feeling I got from fate.  Because fate just seems like he's not in reality.  Feels like it seems like he feels like he's just living a program.  You know, and he struggles with reality.  He does.  Yeah, a little bit.  He spins his own sometimes.  And he has a lot of hard time because of coming out of the coma.  whether he's a waker, he's asleep and all these things for a while.  But it's a world in which less and less is real.  People are dictating AI's now.  It's weird.  I didn't know that.  Oh, I guess I was in Nashville.  It was like West Nashville, I think.  The West Nashville area.  And it's more of an affluent, you know, well to do area.  And I was going into this theater.  And outside there was these two people walking.  One had a leash on an dog face, the dog mask and like ears.  And this other person was walking them on a leash.  and I felt like I was like,  and this is this real, am I awake?  You know, but couldn't get a real dog?  I don't know.  I think it's a thing.  I think that maybe a thing.  It's where the human interaction is messy.  And so we'll see if people can put up with it.  Was, I don't know if he was hallucinating  or what he was doing, but there's one thing  we were talking earlier, where some Looney Tune characters  come into play.  And it reminded me of your watch The Boys.  Oh yeah, for sure.  Oh that's what?  There's just one character that, you know,  hallucinates about all these cartoon characters and stuff.  And it reminded me of that when that scene came up.  And I just started laughing.  Is that kind of the angle you were going with?  Yeah, I mean, fade as, I mean, that's a flashback.  So I needed to just talk a little bit about Fade's background.  And the best way to do that, I felt like, was as he's waking up from this coma that he  would have flashbacks to critical moments in his life.  So that's kind of a scene from the first book fade.  But with more kind of surreal stuff put into it.  So I kind of put dream stuff, a little bit of dreamy, not completely realistic stuff  in it to kind of denote that it wasn't real, that it was a dream as he's coming out of  this coma.  And that I wanted to get all that a little bit out of the way for so that you'd know who  he was.  He was a really well established and understandable character, even though he's a complicating  character. And then you could move forward and learn about his arc as he recovers from  the coma and then gets sort of dragged in to get swept into this group that you know  in a way or trying to take over the world right. I mean John Lewis says that at one point  laughs about it. Yeah. But he's like you know but I'm kind of serious. Like somebody's got  to ride herd over this or we're going to have chaos.  Well, I think it, I think he does it a couple of times in the book.  Yeah. Yeah. And so I got the, he wants to take over the world.  I think he does, but I think in a way, he didn't feel like it was realistic.  And then he's been very surprised at how easy it is.  How easy it is. Yeah. And I think about like, you know, the Trump administration.  now how little, you know, you think about the United States,  we'll step all these checks and balances and things.  And what you're finding is that Donald Trump  and whatever he dreams up, he can do.  And so it's kind of that way with John Trump.  He's in the horizon.  And I mean, that's been the history of every administration  is that, you know, they try to push the limits to.  Yeah.  And he's just pushing it really, I thought,  There might be some pushback like occupying cities with the military would be like people would be uncomfortable with that  But or working entirely through executive order for things like this  You know things people complained about under the Obama administration. Right. See much more  I just can't think of anything he could do that he would get pushback on he's  who he wants so and that's kind of what low is finding out is that and I think he tells fade this at some point that  you just do whatever you want until people push back,  but no one ever does.  And so as long as you got a lot of money or power,  people will bend the knee to you.  And that's been sort of the history of humanity,  to some extent.  Amazing ability for one person to take over a country  and rule millions with an iron fist.  Even if they'd like a rack,  understood how I'm saying,  he was part of an ethnic minority.  But he ruled that place with an iron phase.  He'd even looked at him wrong.  You were dead.  Family was dead and your village was burned.  And so, you know, it's kind of amazing  that he was able to do that.  Yeah.  And through history, we've seen that.  Yeah. And now you have systems of control  that are beyond anything we've ever seen.  Right? I mean, Donald Trump could easily just take  over Facebook and ask easily.  I mean, I don't think you'd have to force them.  just say I'm doing it and they go, okay, that's pretty much what they've done.  I think there'll be a little more pushback than that.  I don't think not at all. I don't think at all. I mean, certainly they've all bent the knee to him.  Now I, you know, Amazon, like these guys, they're, they do what he's, they're told.  And he could do that and just be like, take, take everything off that's negative about.  I think that they also did that under the other previous administrations is they just, they did what they  I don't think they really ask her they were told also. I don't think they were asked. I don't think those guys  How does that much imagination? I feel like Trump has a lot of imagination  He does  I don't know I mean certainly they asked to take down  So and the only thing I think it would Biden is he wanted them to take down  Like the naked pictures of his son they had hacked his phone. Well, it's not just  So that's the other things that they wanted them to do.  It's not like take this down, don't do this.  It's like do this and put this information with COVID.  Put this information out and stuff like that.  With a lot of different things.  So, and yeah, they could have.  This isn't about, it's not about Trump.  They could have.  All they have to do is tell these billionaires  is you all take your money away.  Or not even take your money away.  I'll just cut your profit margin by one 10th of 1%.  sell their children to you over there.  So it's really interesting the power dynamics and how that's happening.  You think of Putin.  Iron-fisted control over his country.  You would think he wouldn't have that.  There are modern European country, but you can do anything these once.  He can march a million people off to Ukraine to die, and they do it.  So I mean, you'd have a hard time convincing me to go to you to try to take over Ukraine  to go get shot at by the Ukrainians.  I'd say, don't we have enough land here?  I mean, United States, nice place.  I don't feel like I want to die to Greenland  being a perfect example.  I go die to take over some big frozen place  or what?  I've been a hunt seals over there.  No, thank you.  Hunt seals.  So it's very interesting in this dynamic.  And low, I guess a little like Trump has imagination.  It's like, well, I'm going to try it.  We put a little bit into that into the book.  I noticed that there were some jabs at the current  administration in here.  Were there?  Was it intentional?  Okay.  Yeah.  Link.  It did any administration.  So you'll notice in my books, there is no Democrat or Republican.  There are none of those issues because this is,  Partisanship is a scam,  voiced it on us by the elites.  It's a tool for control.  It's a tool for control.  It's a great party.  There's a great thing on Vox.  They did a thing on Tucker Carlson and stuff.  He said a long time ago,  and he comes right out and says it.  He's like, I'm the ultimate elitist,  and I gotta keep people fighting,  and I think he says,  so they never look over my wall.  Right? They don't want people to know I live in the wealthiest county in the United States.  And nobody really wants to know what level of privilege that it's, you know, it's  probably not ones and you know, all this. And it's on both sides. It's nothing to do. They don't care.  Go to a party with a bunch of billionaires. They don't care what your politics are. It's about  money and power. Now you're making sure everybody fighting to where you've probably interacted with  with both the super-richly and the politicians.  I have.  And on both sides of the aisle, because sometimes  one guy's in power, sometimes the other guy's in power,  and nobody cares.  They're just gonna give whoever's in power money.  And it's all about maintaining that elite level.  level. Nobody they're not patriots or like it's just about power. So that's what I want to get  across. Don't get fooled by this partisan stuff because the people at the high level are not  playing that game. Nobody much longer game. None of them care about you. All they care about are  themselves. And so John Lowe is hoping to pull that back because it's a lot of times also that  the people who come very wealthy and very powerful just the people you don't want to be there.  Yeah.  Because they don't want to be like that dictator.  Kind of got confused.  He's like, you know, I'll just take complete control.  You know, he's super rich.  He doesn't have a family.  No friends that, you know, this is how you paint the picture of this guy.  Right.  You know, he's a master manipulator, but he's also a visionary.  and he's got this goal, he seems to be very focused.  Yeah, exactly.  And hopefully it's a benevolent goal.  He seems to think it is, but you know,  the question is is it?  I mean, how much control is he willing to take?  Yeah.  And I'm not gonna tell you anything here.  That you do a good job of paying that picture of,  I don't really know about this guy.  It sounds like, you know, women in these this way and then another man and he's, you know,  genuine and I think fade sees that also.  Um, but yeah, and the danger is giving the planet a giving way that power.  And it doesn't matter if you're giving it to Trump or Biden, these are irrelevant details.  Yeah.  The problem is giving it because like tyranny can come from the left, like it did Soviet  Union, China can come from the right like it did with Hitler.  But it's something that democracy doesn't last long.  It's not the normal way that humans organize themselves,  which is strange because it's extremely successful,  like extremely successful.  But for some reason, people get tired of it and give it away.  And now we have it. It's not just the politicians,  but it's to these groups of very powerful,  most great hyper wealthy people democracy doesn't last because of greed because someone wants to take it all  and a bunch of us are willing to give it away for two to take this yeah i'll give you this if you  give me this right you know it's one of the things i loved about george or wells books like  1984 animal farm is that he really never portrayed the downtrodden people as the good guys  because they were had been manipulated into this through their own greed, their own hatred,  their racism, their whatever nationalism, and they had been manipulated into giving up their power  to this dictator. So they weren't the good guys. You know, they just were the unsuccessful ones.  Yeah, the Victor writes history, right? Exactly. Exactly. So John Lowe, he's one of the  major characters in this. Let's run through a couple of other Maddie again is, you know,  another main character. Was he in the, I assume he was in the prequel as well?  Yeah. So yeah, fades like at one time best friend, they were in the military together in  CIA together and then had a pretty serious falling out, almost killed each other. Now Maddie  begins at a very different place in his life and fade is, um, yeah, trying to deal with them and  they're trying to figure out what their relationship is now. I like complicated relationships,  between people. Yeah. And again, through the through the whole book, I just get, you know, if I'm  putting myself in fades shoes, I just feel like I'm in a days. He doesn't know if it's real or, you know,  fantasy throughout the whole thing. And, you know, good reason because of his condition and, you know,  maybe all this stuff they're pumping into him. We haven't even got to that yet, you know, this machine,  Yeah, the mystery machine that's brought him back to life, you know, kind of deal.  And you're saying, I think I saw an interview that you did.  You're saying like that machine actually exists.  You basically, basically, don't something.  Well, to some extent, the, certainly one thing you should look at is leads, the elites,  right?  They were talking about like the CEOs of companies and stuff.  They're pretty old.  And they're all super jacked.  knows that. I mean, really, I'm really fast. Like Zuckerberg is fast. 10K. They're not doing  that with bands in their office. Bezos is what he is. Yeah, Bezos like, he's like, he's  not an old picture of Bezos. He's a scrawny little geek. Now it looks like a James Bond  to one. Yeah. They're not doing that because he's in the gym, you know, six hours a day.  Let me tell you, they got the good stuff. Also like, Fade was talking about, like, getting  infused with the blood of young people, which they've done studies on. They've done  that's very much on the down low,  but that is a real thing.  And you, you know, it would work, I think.  Well, you know, but also, you know,  right now, elites are picking their embryos, right?  They do in vitro and they do genetic testing  on their embryos and they want a smart one,  an athletic one and all that.  Something that the average person can't do.  So these elites, and this is kind of inspired by a party  I once went to with a bunch of, you know,  very, very wealthy people and their children,  these kids are gonna be amazing, right?  They're gonna be brilliant and hard working  and they're all gonna intermarry  and then they're gonna inherit their parents' money  and they're all going to be,  yeah, just becoming entrenched up here  and everybody else will be sort of down here.  Yeah.  But the child's, the children's blood,  you know, you bring that, that was kind of the thing  that they were jacking into him.  But that's been in fiction for decades and decades,  like the vampires,  and they would drink the children's blood or whatever.  I can't remember that there was another character,  a fictional character, she was a female,  and that's how she stayed young.  She would bathe and...  Oh, that was actually a real character from the,  I don't know, was it?  It was based on it's 800s or something  some mean or something that was that she did that. Yeah. But this, the studies have shown  that it works in animals. And there was some crazy guy I can never remember his name.  He was trying to live forever with all this stuff. And now he started a cult, I think. But he was  transfusing, I think, the blood of his son. He said, he stopped doing it and said, no, no, it doesn't  work. And so I'm guessing somebody got to him, frankly, they were like, we don't need to go down  this path because people will be snatching children off the street and like bleeding them dry.  So they already are. Yeah, which is true. Yeah, it was probably a true. That's one of the reasons,  maybe. So it's, yeah, these people have, you know, they're going to have access to therapies we  don't because they're too expensive or too difficult to administer. And that's something I'm showing  this and these, you know, the power of that is going to be huge in the power of their  and their ability to circle the wagons and just create a hereditary elite like it was hundreds  of years ago. Their children will have money. They'll frankly, they'll have been selected  from an embryo, any genetic defects that were a problem. They'll deal with that with  with Prince being around the, um, the, um,  inbred issues, you know, that the,  oh, that's easily fixed.  Egyptians and the kings, you know, that, you know,  I think they all got around it by all the women  who are having sex with the, uh,  with their security guards.  Curing ours.  Yeah. Cause I mean,  they're doing the genetic testing of like old royalty.  They're like, this guy isn't who you think he is.  Yeah.  He's got DNA.  Those women weren't stupid.  Somebody.  Yeah.  But with genetic manipulation that they can do nowadays,  they can bypass that.  And again, it's genetically enhanced and be genetically elite.  Yeah.  And it's interesting, because H.E.L.  was a tree wells wrote a book called The Time Machine.  And it was about the upper classes evolving away  from the lower classes.  And the lower classes became these cannibalistic cave  dwelling apes and not for classes, you know, war togas and  are all blonde. And great. Yeah. And, but as is so often true, he  did it was much worse than he imagined because evolution takes  a long time. But genetic manipulation doesn't say that's one  generation. They can fix it. So there's so much smarter, faster  and stronger, they brought back the dire wolf.  Yeah, it's really a Jurassic Park is real.  Yeah, it's fascinating.  Can you imagine in another generation  that some Jeff Bezos' kid is not only going to be  having IQ of 160, he's going to be a four minute  mileer and a pro level boxer.  It can breathe in outer space.  Yeah, and it's like, and then how are you going to compete with that kid?  Are you going to dislodge them from their position?  We die out, you know, SP ons die out and the new evolution of mankind is on its way.  And we love that.  Like so, I mean, think about dynasties, you know, the bushes, you know, Clinton.  I was one of the reasons I know everybody hated Hillary Clinton, but the thing I hated about  most was that she got there as a family dynasty. She wouldn't have been there if it hadn't been  for Bill Clinton. It's neither with George Bush II. And so, you know, you worry that, okay, now  Donald Trump will leave and then it'll be Don Jr. And then it'll be barren. And you know, those  family diaspora, you can't get rid of them. Even Donald Trump's father, you know, they were big into  the politics. So it'll be interesting to see if you can, and then after generation, you know,  20 years of say the Trump's or the Clintons or heck people were talking about Michelle Obama running  or the Obama says, no matter, they get so much power, they accumulate so much power,  they then you can never dislodge them. Then it's Obama's kids, then it's his grandkids,  whatever, right? Yeah. Yeah. You got to be super careful about that. It's same thing happens.  with fame or with, you know, Sonny Bono was in Congress.  And then I think it meant his wife, I think,  that she took over for him, I think.  And so these people get very entrenched.  I wish you could go through every, I don't know,  there were some of the questions you know every few years.  It's got rid of all of them.  Yeah.  Well, turning it.  Totally. We all know that that's the problem is that they get in there and they get,  you know, they go in there as a thousand air and they come out as a, you know, billion air.  Yeah. And you can't get around. And this is something else that's very much part of this book.  You can never get rid of them. So the sun's which is like 90 years old.  Yeah. Or, you know, Biden trump all of them.  And you think when's the last time you needed it?  You thought I needed it, innovative solution  to a complicated problem.  Find me a 90 year old.  You know, I mean, it's, you know,  my heart needs grandpa.  How to fix my phone, right?  That's not what you're doing.  But that's what we're doing, right?  We have all these really complicated problems  that are gonna affect the next generation.  So let's get a bunch of people over 80 to try to solve them.  I mean, it's kind of like a lot to think about.  Yeah.  Today we're cleaning the SIGP365.  You're gonna wanna follow the SIG guidelines  for disassembly and reassemble.  You wanna take the firearm apart,  put it out piece by piece,  and then you're gonna grab your favorite  one CLP plus product. Whether it's paste, liquid, or aerosol, they're all going to do the same thing.  Today we're using the paste. You can see that it comes out and it spreads very easily.  Using the nylon brush you're going to go in and you're going to cover the entire fire on.  Inside now we are safe on all metals, plastics, composites, rubber, wood, leather.  So you're going to go piece by piece, put it on there, wiping it on to clean it.  Then you're going to go back and you're going to wipe it off.  Remember, seal one is a wipe-on wipe-off process.  Use Q-tips to get down on the little looks and prannies that the microfiber cloth does  not get to.  The wipe-it all off and do not forget to do the magazine.  periodically you're going to want to take the magazine apart to clean the insides.  You're going to reassemble according to the manufacturer's guidelines.  Get it together. You're going to perform a function test, make sure it's operating properly,  and then you're done. Remember, seal one and done.  Seal one is a proud sponsor of the Talking Lead podcast and the lead head brigade.  Use the code lead head for a 25% off discount.  We didn't really talk much about Matt, but they used to be friends had a falling out.  Matt's kind of his hand learning.  I guess kind of to the degree anybody can handle fade.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  He's kind of giving him his his missions and and whatnot.  He reminds me of.  Oh, as I'm reading this, I was actually putting like, I was trying to put who  would play that part, you know, kind of deal.  Oh, in a movie?  Yeah, in a movie.  I never think in those terms.  Do you not?  No.  I'm more of a book guy than a movie, guys.  But not after the fact, after you've done it, it's like, if it were a TV  series or maybe who would who would I want to play?  Originally, when I did fade 20 years ago, I thought Brad Pitt, who isn't  era, but I was like, they could make him up to look Arab, because he does  likable but crazy really well. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we've been 20 years ago. That's true.  When I wrote that book. So he was just like I thought, that's the guy to do just kind of like  completely nuts and homicidal. But you, but you really like him funny. You know, all that kind of  stuff. Good looking. Apparently he's looking. Like a really good looking dude. Yeah. As you paint the  picture of him. Yeah. What does he, I've  fade describes himself as like the cross between a  bollywood action star and and and and a like  al-Qaeda terrorist. Yeah. I noticed that you did some  characters of some of the characters. Yeah. For the  release of the book. And then for him, you don't, you  know, other ones have faces and you know, all this. And for  him you just kind of got some long hair over a face where you don't really have a face  there.  Let me say it was intentional.  Totally intentional because I feel like we're dealing with a main character.  Everybody creates their own, you know, and they're not necessarily like what you described.  So I wanted to keep him a little mysterious.  So when people read the book, they could put together what they thought he looked like.  I still haven't, I haven't painted a picture of him yet.  Now, I got a solid, you know, this is,  is him and what he looks like.  In my mind, he really looks like,  I gotta, again, this is gonna date,  the date me a little bit,  but I don't know if people remember the movie,  the mummy.  It was like the first one I'd brand in Fraser in it.  I mean, it's a long time ago.  It's a great movie.  But there was, he had kind of this sidekick  who was an Arab guy who's played by,  I think his name's Obed,  but I can't remember his last name.  And he had like tattoos under his eyes and long hair.  And he was always kind of,  when I picture him, I kind of picture that guy a little bit.  So here is that cast.  Yeah. And so where is he?  Is it this guy?  Arnold?  You might have to go down a little bit and say you can find him.  I would.  Is he this guy?  Oh, yeah, there is.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I said, oh, bad.  His name's Odad.  Odad.  Okay.  But I mean, obviously he's much older here.  But if you see a picture of him from that era, he has like kind of tattoos under his eyes.  He looks in many ways the way that I was thinking  that favor look up you just said in  Like you search for it in India jet or no, it's called the mommy  That one yeah, yeah  I don't know that you would ever wear that outfit, but oh, yeah, yeah  But yeah, I get I get what you're saying I was thinking  This guy from when you said the mummy I was like oh yeah, it's this guy  Get to me back. We got that actually played the mummy. Yeah, this guy. Yeah. Oh, that guy. Well. Yeah. Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the other guy. I don't know that don't see that of course. He's also bald so maybe that's that's what's throwing  Yeah, hair on there and yeah, but you know obviously Arab looking  So I always you know I definitely picture him that way which is  is kind of important to his character.  I mean, he does speak Arabic.  He comes from a Muslim, you know, a devout Muslim family.  He's not religious, but comes from not background.  So, and that informs, you know, to some extent who he is.  Yeah.  So, there's, and not as much as I was thinking there would be  with this guy being a multi-billionaire  and having unlimited resources and things like that.  There's this one scene that thought was really cool  where, and it didn't have fate in it.  It was Matt and him and they were headed to go meet,  what's the guy's name?  Boo, boo, boogers.  Oh, Bochang.  Bochang.  Yeah.  and they get rated and you know, Matt's like trying to get all tactical and do this and  and low saying just stay in the truck.  Just stay in the truck.  But you know, Matt gets out and then all of a sudden people just start dropping.  You know, I thought that was kind of cool too.  Yeah, you know, you can't control them.  Can't the sometimes the reality on the ground is different than it is back in headquarters.  What kind of research did you do as far as the weapons of technology that you use in this,  that machine that they talk about, some of the drone weapons that he was used in the...  Well, the machine is definitely all about the performance enhancing drugs.  Obviously, the blood thing I read, the studies on that, but also the cocktails of performance  hand-hancing drugs that people are on. And what we talked about earlier that all the  sudden all these CEOs not to mention actors, I mean, my God, actors will go from looking  like me to looking like Schwarzenegger in three months for a role.  Joe, that was not a thing before. And so that was part of the research I did. I learned a lot more  about performance and answering drugs that I ever thought I would ever need to know.  What's the good ones? What do we need to be? Oh man, there's so many good ones, but they're  so dangerous, like trend. You want to get jacked, man. And you don't care if you die.  Hit that one. What's that procedure that people are having done now? They're going down to  Tijuana. And it. I don't know what it. Yeah, to get more muscular. No, well, it's for repair and  healing. There's all kinds of that stuff with like centrifuging your blood and stem cell and  all that. But I'm not sure any of that works. I could never find a one because I was trying to  obviously heal him quickly. I hate like this soap opera, coma thing, where the guy wakes up from the  coma and he's fine. Yeah, you know, that just not happened. Let me tell you. And so I was trying to  to find all these kind of next gen therapies.  But those kinds of things, I don't find work.  The drugs though, they definitely work.  So there was definitely there.  The stem cell there because a lot of athletes  are having that done.  Yeah.  But I'm not sure it works.  You might just be a placebo-affected-expensive,  expensive.  It would be for a specific injury.  But I actually looked into it once,  but I was unconvinced.  It's one of those things that seems like it should work,  but I'm not sure it does.  And then certainly the AI controlled weaponry  with drones and things, that's out there.  That's just in its first stages.  And that's gonna completely transform warfare.  But in ways that I'm not sure of,  because I would say that warfare, modern warfare  is unprofitable. There's no way you can really, yeah, I mean, there's no way to have a war  in this day and age and come out better for it, starting a war. You can't make it up.  You know, the good old days when you were the Romans, you're like, oh, we're going to go in here,  we're going to kill and enslave everybody and take all their stuff. That was profitable.  But there's too much destruction, too many insurgencies,  the international community won't let you take  all their stuff, things like that.  So it's really not profitable.  And now with the drones,  I mean, in the next few years,  it's going to become incredibly unprofitable in that.  Well, it's not an asshole of no destruction.  It's gonna be crazy.  It's a sense of looting,  but it is profitable in the sense of,  I make bombs, I make drones, you buy all these bombs, all these drones, all these bullets,  all these guns, all these uniforms, you know, all that.  For the industry, it's very profitable.  Extreme countries, not so much.  So there's no reason to start a war.  I mean, Russia being the perfect example for profit.  Yeah, to better yourself, like rushes,  if they took all of Ukraine, they would not be better off.  They're worse off.  Now they got Finland in NATO,  sitting all along their border.  Sweeten, the poles are rearming like crazy.  They're an incredible fighting force.  The rest of Europe is now rearming.  There's so much worse off.  Got lost a million men.  They already have a collapse in their population.  So that's a perfect example, Hamas.  I don't even know what happened there.  But it's certainly not profitable for them,  not profitable for the Israelis  have certainly not benefited from this.  And so this is, and then with drone warfare,  that's going to become an order of magnitude worse.  And the obvious one is China invading Taiwan.  Yeah, I to me is very worrying and very interesting to me because their window is closing  Pretty soon that technology is going to be such that you cannot attack a country like Taiwan without losing  Yeah, three million people in the first day, you know, so it's a  And maybe that I thought that would take us into a post-war  period, but I think it's just gonna  turn us into a really, really deadly horrible war period because people are still going to want to go to war.  Well, if we like it, what do you think the next conflict is going to be? What's the next?  I don't hear your story. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe Iran. I worry about China every day.  Because that's just gonna be a bloodbath and there's no again, no reason to do it China's plan on land  I don't think anything they want. I don't think that's gonna  I don't think it's gonna happen. I don't think so  But I would have said Russia is not going to invade Ukraine and Hamas is not going to commit suicide  In Israel either I wouldn't I would have laid 90% higher than 90% odds of both those  Oh really? Yeah. I would have said Russia. I mean once they started making noise about it.  Yes, but 15 years ago, why on earth would Russia want to get involved in something like  that? So hopefully China's saying rational resources. I mean, I don't know. They don't need  them. I mean, I mean, Russia's massive and full of resources. And now there are sanctioned.  I mean, it's just, I don't know, to me, it just didn't make any sense.  Yeah.  And it's not going to be just in light.  So, I mean, he didn't like the boy actor.  I don't know.  He did.  I guess he didn't.  But boy, he had to be the great thing about being Putin is you're not getting killed.  Because you don't like you, it's Zelensky.  Your million guys are getting killed.  Yeah.  You know, most of them.  Yeah.  So it's, it's, I don't know.  It'll be, it'll be interesting to see.  I mean, maybe, I don't know.  maybe we'll, I forgot about Greenland and Canada and the Panama Canal.  Maybe those are going to be the next ones.  We're willingly, you know, he's given them the option to willingly, to kneel, to kneel.  Yeah, they don't seem to want to.  So we didn't really get into the plot yet of the book.  You know, we were talking about the pandemic earlier, the COVID virus.  And is that a spoiler if we do that?  Well, I mean, it's very much about, yeah,  I mean, not to go into too much detail.  John Lowe wanting to get enough control over the world  to sort of back it down a little bit,  to bring it back from the precipice.  And in the midst of him kind of working toward  what in his mind is a long-term goal.  There's a snag.  There's a snag.  and that the governments of the world  prove incapable of handling it  because they're all circling their wagons  and trying to save themselves.  And he becomes put himself in a situation  where he's kind of uniquely qualified and equipped  to deal with this in much more so than the world.  And so the world's governments.  So he gets sucked into this.  I think much sooner than he felt like he was capable.  And because of that, he has to lean on Fade,  who's sort of his fate and his team  who are kind of his combat wing.  Yeah, they are his sword.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm gonna ask you this,  what are you having as the Dallas Cowboys?  So many people ask me that.  And it's a fun story.  Yeah, and it's a funny story.  Okay. Because I know absolutely nothing about football.  I know less than nothing about football.  But my dad was stationed in D.C. when I was in high school.  And so it was originally the Washington Redskins.  And somebody was reading it, and a friend of mine was reading it,  and for the football sections, because I was like,  I don't even know what anything about it.  And he's like, is this intentional?  Is this like a historical novel?  Like, what do you mean?  The Washington Redskins don't exist anymore.  It's not what they're called.  And I thought, oh shit.  What's a team that for sure will be around  for the next year?  And I think he said that you can count on the Dallas Cowboys.  And I like, so I just changed it.  But yes, it was originally the Washington Redskins,  which are now the Washington something else.  I don't know.  What is it?  or something.  You're not like that.  Yeah.  I think they're actually talking about changing them back to.  And that's why I didn't do it.  Because I said, well, should we just change the name?  He's like, they'll probably change it back.  And I said, OK, what's the most reliable, famous football team in the world that is  not going to change?  But I want to give you a few more kudos if you to kept the Redskins.  He goes like, yes.  No, that would have been a right or right.  That would have been a political, right or left political statement.  I try to stay away from them.  So my goal in a free book is to get hate mail equally  from the left and the right.  For somebody who's saying, that evil president is Joe Biden  and then next day get one be like, that evil president  is supposed to be Donald Trump.  And so I know if I get hate mail from both sides equally,  I've done my job, right?  right down the middle. Equal opportunities, right? Exactly. I like to I'm like South Park. I'll insult anybody.  When you do globe trot a lot on this also, they go to a lot of different  countries.  Grew not a Spain.  Where I live, so that's a lazy thing. That was a lazy thing. That was a lot. Yeah, because I know it really well.  and how that that fade has there.  Is that based on when you've seen there?  Yeah, there's actually on this,  there's a big mountain behind my house that goes up to a national part  and I ride my bike on it a lot  and there's this huge kind of leg.  It'd be now it'd be a mansion, but it was built God knows when  and it's really in ruin.  Yeah, and it's this amazing setting in the olive trees with the huge Sierra and white Sierra Nevada's behind it. Oh, wow  And my wife wanted that house something awful and I was like oh hell no, we're not getting into that  But it would have been so cool in  her mind  To have just in the big holes in the collapse parts to just fill them with glass and then have part of the house  you know, it was gone, but it's still a floor and just like that could be the terrace, but it used to be part of the house.  And so, um, they do that something grease where they'll have a partially collapsed building and they'll turn it into a restaurant and see your like kind of on the half-clapped floor or something.  Right. And so now it's outdoor used to be indoor, but now.  And so that it sort of heard that dream of that house and I thought, I'm going to  build, I'll have him live there.  Like, here's your house in the book.  Yeah, it's in the book.  And then the aqueduct, like him wanting to build  the lazy river with the house.  I was about that.  Yeah, there's a bike ride I really love that's on the,  in the middle of nowhere out on the gravel there.  And it goes by an aqueduct that Napoleon built.  And is now there's only a few arches left of it.  And I thought, what a sweet, lazy river that,  maybe you'd like go along the aqueduct  and then you'd come back to your pool.  I was gonna pull this up.  You probably pull up just Napoleonic aqueduct  or not a Spain and it would probably,  so that's the old Arab fort up there in the left.  It's probably a very, yeah.  There's a huge Arab fort,  that it kind of hangs above the city  that's called the Alumbra.  It's just massive.  Because that's where the last Arabs were kicked out of.  Yeah, that's the Henna Aleefae.  Oh, wow, there's the, yeah, that's what it looks like.  So that's the last place that the Arabs were kicked out  of in 1492 by the Catholic Kings.  The last Arab protectorate in Spain.  Now, I think on the last episode, you were telling me that  maybe the house you were staying at,  you said you just bought a house,  but it had air-bick influence.  Yeah, it was a flat-out air-bryant.  Like you walked through the arches  and it was all Arabic writing.  And I had two front doors,  because you had one front door kind of guess went in  and one front door is family-winning,  because you couldn't see the women.  You weren't able allowed to see the women.  And one of the doors was now bricked up  had my mail slot in it. But that house is about 500 years old. Wow. Okay. And it was cold  and drafty as you might imagine. But I like the the picture that you painted of it. You  know, it sounded really cool. And then right, Riah, is that her name Riah? Riah, yeah.  Riah. She was a interesting character. Also, was that was that kind of pulled from the  headlines as well was she was she a jalain max will kind of  Well, she was one of the young girls, not not the mistress.  On the mistress.  She was kind of stolen from Bulgaria when she was 14 years old and put in  that, you know, on that circuit of the, uh, the rich and famous men, you know,  go to the parties with the young girls, which, yeah, you know, unfortunately,  That's a component in the book next book I'm writing.  And it was way before the, like I wrote all this way  before the Epstein stuff blew up.  So this is sort of again the victim  of being good at predicting stuff.  And you try to write these books  that you think will be a couple of years out  and then history will overtake you.  And so that Ria, I mean that's a little bit,  It's inspired by some of the people that I've hung around and not that I know anybody that I am aware of that goes to those kinds of parties, but I was, I've known a lot of very wealthy people when I lived in London, a lot of very wealthy Arabs that I was friends with.  And let me tell you, go to the bars that they go to,  the ones that you can't just walk into,  that you're going with them.  And you realize every woman in here,  six foot one and gorgeous and 19 years old.  And they're literally dancing on the tables.  Everybody's getting up and dancing on the tables  and everything.  And you think, none of these girls  give me the time of day.  I'm sure they can smell the poverty on me.  Oh, I mean, that's real.  Boy, you go into the parking lot.  We pulled in and like $100,000 BMW,  and it was the crappiest car in the parking lot.  And so that is that and some parties I've been to around Jackson  Hole where I lived that's now very wealthy.  And some of the things with the government that I've done,  I remember once I was going to a football game  with a government guy who I guess should probably  he's dead now, but I'll say he remains nameless.  And we were gonna miss the kickoff.  So we just had the highway going in the opposite  because of the traffic, right?  Just had the highway in the opposite direction closed.  We pulled over the median and just drove the wrong way  up the highway.  And I thought, this is the good life.  So I would've been in that life with my 98 GMC UConn.  on. Yeah, we were in the limo and just pulled over with the police escort because he's like,  I don't want to miss the kickoff. And me and my father were there. We're like, well, you know,  we're sitting in traffic. What are you going to do? And he's like, well, I'm not missing the kickoff.  We made it.  But it's kind of incredible these things to go on. And I wrote a lot of the stuff before the  the Epstein thing, like really ever became a thing.  And now all that's happening is people are aware of it now.  But that kind of stuff has always gone on.  But now it just became front and center  because of Epstein's arrest and his relationship with Donald Trump.  Because it's newsworthy now.  But it's still going on.  I don't know what you mean, the only one.  I mean, it cleanse with extremely wealthy people.  I think it's just, I think it's really become into the forefront now because obviously  Donald Trump is such a big fixture in the news.  Yeah.  But if Clinton had one, then it would be because of her, right?  So, but this is going on all the time.  And that's being one guy that got caught.  I mean, I mean, Kanye, like you're here in a  about like a lot you're just hearing about it all the time now. It's just coming to light.  But do you think he killed him? So you know, I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I did a deep dive into  that kind of about that video and everything and how his neck was broken. He was a guy that it was  very convenient for him to be dead. And now I guess Maxwell's now moved into a much more  comfortable situation and I would not rule that out.  Yeah.  So it's just turned into such a hard situation.  You know, very plausible, right?  It's very plausible.  A lot of very powerful people clearly.  And again, this goes to the elites again.  All of a sudden, no problem.  We're going to release that list.  We're going to release all this stuff.  And then all of a sudden, it turned into,  There's no there's no file. No, just don't don't look here and look over there. Yeah, so it's  Once again, the elites you can't keep them down  You can't hurt them can't keep a good elite down. Yeah, you really can't a great outdoors a  Place where memories are made  Where adventures are born and where the spirit is rejuvenated  If you're amid our commitment goes beyond just providing gear  We're here to connect you to the right product and service.

Guided by our vision, we strive every day  to share our knowledge and passion  for the vast, beautiful world outside  because when you're armed with the best,  every expedition becomes an incredible experience.  Pyramid, adventures, and recreation.  Now, you make some other kind of subtle references in the book.  What's your hang up with 80s female bands?  Well, that was a little bit of a throwback.  I wanted to be, first of all,  fade loves cheerful music.  It's the past a lot.  So he loves the go-go's.  And if he's going to go on a killing spree,  he's definitely going to do it to the go-go's or the Ramones or something.  The Beach Boys and Savvy, John.  You've got Banana Rama.  Banana Rama.  Yeah.  Cause it's fun music for him, but I also,  so I had a book about him like 20 years ago.  And he went into a coma really 20 years ago,  but I wanted to keep this that timeline vague  because the truth is he couldn't have been  in a coma for 20 years.  You've never recovered from that,  no matter how many drugs and armor therapy you have.  So I wanted to keep that time for him vague.  And so you'll notice that I put all kinds of like movie references  and music references that go all the way back to the 80s,  which was way earlier than when I wrote that book.  Yeah, whatever 20 years ago.  And so that his background would be really vague.  There was a book or movie one's called,  I think it was Blue Velvet by David Lynch,  was the director, very strange movie.  The one thing I loved about it was there was no timeframe in it.  Like you'd have a modern car,  but people would be listening to a boom box.  And then like every, the fashion was all different.  And I loved that idea of it was completely timeless.  And so I thought I would do that with this book  where you couldn't totally pinpoint Fade's age or background.  I'm trying to share that.  Pulled it up.  There it is.  I don't think I've ever watched.  I've heard of it.  I don't think I've ever watched it though.  Blue velvet.  It's very David Lynch.  It's a very strange movie.  But if you look in it, there are just like these elements from different times.  It's like, if you made a movie now and somebody had a walkman and then they had this  car from this era.  So that's kind of what I wanted to do  was create this really weird time warp around him  that you could never figure out exactly  what his time roll was.  Because this is what happens with rap too.  Like I had to stop aging him.  Yeah.  Because he was getting so, he's my age,  he'd be almost 60.  Yeah.  We're almost the same age.  I'm 50.  Yeah, just term 59.  So, and then you have all this secondary characters or a problem too.  You know, Mitch Rap has this daughter who's quite young.  But if you didn't age him, but you aged her realistically,  someday she'd be older than him.  So, they didn't work.  So I decided to get really vague and take a little bit of David Lynch.  Yeah.  The little inspiration from David.  I talked to Stephen Hunter about that.  And his character, Bob Lee Swagger, and he ages,  Bob Lee and his throughout his series.  And so did Vince.  Yeah.  I felt like Vince would have worked his way out of that character  and didn't have the character or something,  but I didn't feel like I should do that.  I like the way they do James Bond.  Because James Bond, you just never know,  because I mean he picks up here, he picks up there.  And I like the way that they...  After a while, the events of a character's life,  you know you think about Mitch Raps starting with a Pan M103 which is very visceral to me because  my father was the lead FBI agent on that and it happened at my college graduation dinner.  So I know that Mitch Raps is exactly because he was graduating from college when that happened.  His girlfriend was killed in it. So I know exactly how old he is and as an aging athlete,  I can tell you that jumping through all those windows and stuff like that starts to get harder to get up in the morning  Just trying to tie the shoes, man  It's rough, but I like I like how you did make those you pointed back to some of the 80s references there  I like to go and then you start you it starts off with a quote from tears for fears  Yeah  That quote really every time I hear heard it for years  Even when I thought fade was dead and gone. I never write about him again  The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I ever had. Yeah, that just really made me think of that character always brought him back to me  It's one of my favorite bands. I left your superiors. They're an amazing band. Yeah, it's a little timeless, right?  Have you met him? No, yes  one of them  Um, these are, see that TV series psych?  No, I don't think I've ever heard about it.  Yeah.  So the main character, um, had like a thing for tears for fears and, um,  not the guy, the main guy that sings, but the other guy, I can't remember his  name from tears for fears.  He brought into the show.  He actually brought into the show and he was, he was on the show several times.  Oh, that's cool.  It was cool.  Yeah.  It was kind of cool.  Anything else about the book that we need to let our listeners know.  I mean, it's a great book.  I did the audio just for time and my eyes.  But the guy who did that was his name again, who does the world hammer.  Yeah.  Super, super good guy.  As far as how he does the characters and his pace and his tone keeps you in it.  But like I said, I hadn't read the first one, but you don't need to you guys can jump into it and  and pick up right where  you left off 20 years ago and  It's really good. I enjoy it. What kind of influence did you?  Where did you tap in for this character? Where did he come from? Where did?  fade come from  the initial idea and  And it was when I was probably 16 years old.  And I wasn't a writer and I don't know.  But characters in my life have, or people in my life,  just like everybody really influenced me.  And I was shooting with a friend of my families  who was kind of a legendary Marine, an operator  from Vietnam.  and he had this gun with him, a pistol,  and he had like four rounds for it.  And I swear to God, they were tracer rounds,  which was really weird.  Created a lot of smoke, but it was Russian.  And I had never seen a gun like it, obviously,  because this was still Soviet era.  And I asked him where he had gotten it,  and he said, he's kind of this amped up guide,  It was really funny.  Unlike a lot of operators,  they're pretty stoic.  This guy was a practical joker and really funny.  He got into this big story about some recon he was doing.  Solo recon.  The vehicle were coming and there was going to be this big attack  and blah, blah, blah, blah.  He had to go up.  He's in that story.  He's like, so I'm walking through the jungle.  There's this rushing guy putting his shoes on.  So I shot him in the head and then I went up.  And I wanted this ridge and then he's describing, of course, his brains will all the movements  of the troops and everything is in it.  And then he's like, and I was walking back and I walked by the guy and I had this gun  and I thought, well, it'd be a cool souvenir.  So I took it.  And he's like, that's why they're only four rounds for us.  That's what was in it.  And but it was such a weirdly non-Shalant kind of, so I shot him in the head as being the  sort of a side.  And all his crazy drink and he once almost got me killed and we had to, there was a helicopter  rescue, but I didn't have to get in the helicopter.  He did.  So I'm proud of that.  But I mean, like that guy gets you a lot of trouble.  You can't just leave, leave us hanging on that.  What's that little kayaking mishap?  kayaking, okay.  Yeah.  And so he was a marine and all his kids were like amazing wrestlers and we went on this  kayaking thing down a really, really tough river,  which I saw and it was in flood.  And I looked at it and said,  even it, I was probably 17 at a time and said,  this is a bad idea.  And they were of all kind of like,  oh my God, you're such a pussy.  And I was the only guy with a really kayaking experience  that I pretty decent kayak.  They were working with lesser equipment.  And yeah, that was way too much river.  But it wasn't a rustler.  I was a competitive swimmer, which came in very, very handy.  And so me and one of his sons managed to get out of the river.  Fortunately, I went over waterfall, got sucked down to the bottom,  came up in the hydraulic, got sucked down again.  And when I came up again, I was really close to my kayak, which  trapped in the hydraulic under the waterfall and I got hold of the  bowline and it was full of flotation bags and styrofoam and my friends  kayak had literally snapped in half and I saw it bobbing straight up down the way.  I could get out. I caught up with him and it took us about 40 minutes to get out of  the river because you just couldn't get to the size. These waves were  crashing and there were a lot of big logs that have been torn out and were in  the water. And I had seen the kayak that the John was in and two of his kids collapse. And  so we got out, flagged a ride, went to the Rangers and told him what happened. And we  all ran, went back and ran down to where we, I had seen where this waterfall was that we had  gone over. And they had managed to get into a snag in the middle of the river. And they were  all on the snag, but it was breaking up. And the ranger said, we can't even get a power raft down  here. The water's too high. The only way you could get these people out would be a helicopter,  like lowering a line. But they're like, they're like, it's not like in the movies where people  can just jump onto that thing. We don't have people to do it. And we're like funny story,  recon marine from Vietnam, just get the chopper in. And they did them. We were standing there.  The chopper came in lower the line down and his kids were pretty young. So he had to get  in with them and hold them in a bear hug. And they brought them up and dropped them in  the force and they took him back to get the other kid. And he's like, oh my god, they  It was breaking me in half.  Those kids, it was just a strap here  and he had the kids and weight.  And the helicopter top of him,  he's like, I thought it was gonna snap my spine  and they got all three of them out.  But think about competitive swimming instead of wrestling  if you're looking for a sport.  Oh, before.  Good, good.  Gary's larger than life and some of him is in fade.  Like, actually there's I think there's a story. I can't remember this book or the next one where he throws a  Marine off a battleship  and  um  It was in this.  So that really happened, but he was a Marine you threw an avi guy off the balcony. I think it was in I've heard the story  Yeah, that was him. He also launched a car off the front of an aircraft carrier with the you know with the plane launcher  thing. I see how far it would go. So he was quite a character. Yeah, somebody, you know,  I was speaking once about, and there was a crowd and old guy came up to me and he said,  I didn't know him, but I was in Vietnam. He's like, did you know he ordered the only bayonet  charge in the entire war? I thought, yeah, I totally see that. I'll probably just do it for the  the fun of it. But he was next level. Let me tell you that guy who like, there's a  diagram of to him at the Naval Academy about a bridge he blew up had to crawl under the  bridge with people shooting at him and fell off at blew up and went way down into the  hit con territory and had to come back alone. Which is not like, well for sure he's dead  John Ripley, they actually made a movie about him. I've never seen it though. And he had  come back and they're like, well, for sure he's dead and they're like, now, and then one day  just walk back into camp. Let's see. Is it this guy? Yep. That's him. Okay. But he was my father's  best friend. Okay.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  A character.  Let me tell you.  Is that him?  There's a book.  There's a book on him there.  Yes.  And then I think they made a movie about him too.  But I don't think I've ever seen it.  I know I've never seen it.  But I think they made a movie.  Well, I'll just say that.  And so he, I mean, he is not the personality of fades way more out there than this guy was.  was, but man, I can just remember a lot of fun dinners and things with that guy just  drinking like we're all drinking like crazy and just like the almost outrageous character ever.  And just such an incredible legend like the stories that people tell about them are just like  superhuman. So always he always makes me think of Mitch rap and Scott Harvath and fade as the guys  that were just like unkillable.  Yeah.  And I got to imagine that, again, with your father's, what he did for a living and all these  interesting characters that you've met throughout your life, that that's had a big, obviously  a big influence on the way you ride in the characters that you ride and how they are.  What other real life people that you pull into for these characters?  I think a lot of them were just composites.  You know, I've been really lucky to know, you know, Bill Webster, who just recently  died, who was the director of the FBI and the CIA.  He helped me a lot when I was first getting started.  But MI6 and MI5 guys when my father went to London, the SAS, who were really incredible  group of people.  So it's, I mean, that's what I like, those were always the friends of the family from  as long as I could remember because I was four years old, you know?  So I got a real flavor of who these people were and, you know, what they did over the course  of my life.  So it became very easy to create these characters because they were compositive.  person I met and that person I met and they do something, you know, some of the scenarios  in my books really happened where they're just a slight twist on something that really happened.  You know, I, there's a scene in my first book where the FBI agent, like somebody  Rob's banking, kills some of the guard and the FBI agents, having a haircut, he doesn't have his  gun with him and he's like, I'm going to get, I'm just going to get into the chase, but I'll just  stay behind the police and just come in when it's all over like the hero and turns a corner  and finds out he turned it in front of the police and he was right behind the suspect.  And that gets into a gunfight but doesn't have his gun. That actually happened to my father.  That was a story that was directly about him.  And so a lot of those things, the stories I heard over the years and stuff  work their way into the books in somewhere or another.  Yeah.  I know earlier you said that, you know, when you're writing your books, you never think  of people that are going to play them, you know, never thinking movie aspects.  But I mean, this character, I mean, he definitely has big screen potential in my opinion.  Could be, you know, it's a little different.  know that's I don't know if people are looking for that you know it's it's it's definitely an  action thriller but it's also dealing you know with some gray area between good and evil as opposed  to you know got a white hot black hat and it's got a character who's not as squared away as a  Mitch Rapper's got harvath or many of the that's what our motivations are complicated.  That's what I like about it.  That's what I like about this character is that he's kind of the anti-hero.  You know?  Yeah, for sure.  He's got his own morals and way of doing things.  It's different from your Captain America type.  Yeah.  He was never a boy scout.  I can guarantee that.  And then people that you surround him with just kind of add to that whole dynamic.  And again, in my opinion, I'm not a Hollywood producer or anything like that.  I think this would be a very interesting, like a multi-series, not a movie,  but if you could do like one of those.  Like a mid-series of it. Yeah.  I think it'd be super fun and interesting.  And you could find, if you could get the right actor and, you know,  who was really compelling?  Yeah.  The Hollywood works in this serious way as though.  They make movies that I think that's as stupid as decision you ever made in your life  Why don't you just pick I got like 20 friends who could give you a book that's 10 times better than that?  It's already written  Why remake why do a reboot?  You know like red dawn for instance  I'll just throw red dawn out there. I mean they  Red dawn was like perfect the way it was great movie. Yeah, and then they tried to reboot it and  Bring it back. He's like you could have just done  another movie called it something else and kind of just changed it up a little bit and you  had your own movie.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But they are a weird, I mean, it's just they have a whole other dynamic than books.  Like, you know, you've got to think about how much the movie cost to make and who you can  get for it and then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all stuff I've never been involved  in by design.  Yeah.  Well, you know people.  So yeah, but I got asked to do a movie with this big movie director from India and I have to admit I was just like, oh man, it just seems like too much work.  I'm talking. I didn't do it.  So you're gonna have to up that pay a little bit. Yeah.  First of all, it's my job.  But, Kyle, I know you gotta go.  I told you we'd keep it around two hours here.  But I really appreciate you letting me know about the book  for one.  I definitely am gonna go back and get the first one.  I'm gonna go check it out, read it.  Yeah, well, let me know what you think of it when you're talking.  I can only again, assume that there's gonna be another one  of these coming up because you left it wide ass open.  Yeah, well, the hope is that will be the start of a series that continues to explore all  the weird stuff going on in the world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's, it's easily digestible too, you know, as far as the length and and whatnot.  So hopefully, I'm trying to, it's trying to drone on forever.  So for those lead heads who aren't watching the screen, you can go to Kyle Mills website  It's calmills.com and it's at calmills author on looks like most of the social media is there.  X and Instagram and Facebook.  You guys can go go give them a follow and then I guess Amazon is that the best place to go?  Yeah, I mean bookstores Amazon whatever your favorite way to buy your book.  What's your tour?  You got a book signing tour or you're.  I did it.  Yeah, it's done.  Didn't come to national.  We did not come to Nashville this time.  So, maybe next time.  Because last time I told you if you come to Nashville, I'll take you to roll range.  That's right.  And we'll shoot some full out of you.  Somebody, you know, I need a bookstore to invite me though.  Is that what it takes?  Yeah, it's kind of along those.  Like, if you know you have to have a bookstore that likes to do thrillers and likes to do events.  Does it have to be a range?  Could be yeah, see if I can get my convinced my publisher to  Pay for me to go and shoot guns and drink whiskey. Yeah. That's good to me  Go, uh, I'll take you downtown. Well downtown Nashville's just for tours, but we'll take you somewhere fun. Yeah  I'd love it  Check it out guys fade in calm hills latest through the runoff will hear do you have anything else?  Besides the the fade series that you're working on  Yeah.  Now I'm just working on that.  I can only do one book a year.  So I'm halfway through the next one and probably come out in January of 2027, I think.  Okay.  That's what I figure I'll get it done.  You say you can only do is that just time-wise, you know.  Just time-wise, focus-wise, a lot of some authors can do multiple books a year, but I have  to drill in on one and it takes me about a year.  Okay.  Very good.  Well again Kyle thank you so much for being on the show.  Know the lead heads are going to love this book and more to come from Kyle Mills.  Thank you. Thanks for having me on.  Anything else we need to deploy or you want to get out there?  I don't think so. That's all I do.  Well I wanted to ask you more about your bike riding you know since you don't do the rock  climbing anymore it kind of your you know your hobbies and then talk more about Spain but that'll  give us an excuse to have you back on and we can talk.  And we don't have to just talk books when you come on if you, you know, if you want to just  come on one of like one of our topic shows, I'd love to have you come on.  Yeah, sure.  Just let me know.  Let me know.  Actually, I'm going to try to start climbing again, but we'll see how that goes.  So maybe the next time I talked to you, I'll gotten back into it.  Okay.  We're going to talk about this guy named Jim Fountain.  Does that ring a bell?  Yes, but I don't know why.  Vietnam. Um, oh, what was that? Uh, I can't remember. Anyway, we're going to talk about him  because I have a guy that actually knew him and worked with him and, um, we're going to talk about  that. So that's the cool. You should get Jack Carter did that because he just wrote a book, a historical  book about Vietnam. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I felt like having those characters father or something,  All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be good to you.  And Jack.  Which is well. I mean, he's the military.  I've say, like I said, my, uh, I'm, I'm doing a lot of military expertise.  You got the espionage, uh, you know, side. Yes.  I got that covered. But right.  And that's what he, that's what this Jim Fountain guy was more into.  Was the, uh, the espionage.  It was red something. Well, I don't know.  I can't remember what it is right now, but put me on the spot, man.  But I will definitely invite you and at your leisure if you'd like to join us for some of our  our other recordings would love to have you on. Yeah, that'd be great. All right. Keep me posted.

We cut to Mike who delivers meat on his bicycle.  I'm rinsing your girl out, bud.  That's how I identify the dodeca-neadrome.  Hello, my name is Nick. I have Shaft here.  scrubbing the pot which is what I call when I jerk myself off. We're just joking.  Hi everything's jokes. Two girls one cup? No. Two guys one screen? Yes.  Hello and welcome to episode 66 of the two guys one screen podcast AKA the  Hemroid homies AKA the Poe Town Boys. My name is Nick and I'm joined by my  lovely co-host Gert. Hey and we are in my fucking take.  No, we're not.  I mean, I've never been.  You've been.  I've been and it's fuck, it's bum fuck.  I'm called the respect Texas is bum fuck.  I mean, this movie portrays that perfectly, huh?  Yeah, you really, I mean,  bunch of them.  First, I went to Texas was right before COVID happened.  And my sister picked me up from the airport  and she lived in whatever place at that time.  And she's like, oh, the navigation's taking me a weird way.  And I was like, you fucking, yeah, it is cause if you're on a fucking road, it was wild.  It was just like nothing.  It was just tall grass and like a random house, no driveway.  Another random house, just like fucking crazy.  But they got buckies.  Shout the buckies, I have a buckies hat.  Never been.  I want to be.  I want to be a Barbie girl.  Um, if that Barbie girl is Nargo Robbie and I'm laying pipe, then yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not going to rob you not in this film.  I don't know if she was a lot.  I was important yet.  I mean, I would say it's for sure it's safe to say pre-pubescent.  It's pre-9-11 for sure.  I'm going to go rape me.  I mean, she was born in the 90s.  Showing 35?  Wow.  She looks phenomenal.  I mean, not that 35 is very old.  Who's your spouse?  Tom accurately shouted Tom accurately you're a lucky son of a bitch.  Yo, all the kid kind of is a piece of the beard on.  the beard on. Oh yeah. Well let me do this math real quick. 1974 minus 1967. Wow I  did math wrong. I figured how old big length was? No, uh, Crispin Wall was seven  years old when this movie came out. Seven years old. Probably had no CT yet. I'd hope not.  Not no head damage unless his parents were thrown down the stairs. Which is possible.  We're very bad at this on this podcast,  but we start talking and we are doing  the Texas Chainsaw Massacre today.  Yeah.  That's why we're doing it and you're probably wondering  well you didn't say that last week.  Yeah, we fucking didn't because we decided  off the rip to do this because this takes place  on August 18th and 1973.  And it's coming out on August 18th, 2025.  The 52nd anniversary.  Also the theaters are putting it back out.  Yeah. Yeah. So we're doing it.  But and technically we'll get dark night on Friday.  Technically, the movie came out in October 1974.  It takes place in August of 73, but it came out in October 74.  So they were like, oh, tragedy? Let's make a movie.  I mean, it's not a real tragedy. Why not?  What do you mean? It's not based on a true story.  I thought you were saying, yeah, I'm a fucking idiot.  Sorry.  I mean, it's loosely, leather face himself is loosely based on ed gain.  Who they mentioned in House of a Thousand Corps is shout out to Ed.  Yeah.  But they said he was a cannibal in that movie and he wasn't.  He just skint, he like grabbed grave skinned people and like wore them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the skin head, right?  probably was. No, he loved his model. Like he wanted to fuck his mom. That's wrong. That is wrong.  Yeah, you shouldn't want to fuck your mom. No, unless your mom's a piece, but yeah,  if your mom's a mom, it's what it is. Yeah, your mom's a remogger Robbie, we get it. Right.  Uh, I guess we should do a, so follow us on Instagram. Two guys, one screen pod, send any  comments, concerns, movie requests to two guys, one screen pod at gmail.com.

It's our physical media collection pod.  It's gonna come out eventually, like,  constipated shit.  It's gonna come out.  Random thought, cause it would involve me going to Boston again.  Okay, now game.  November.  Do you know where the house of blues is?  In Boston?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know where it is.  Well, Avatar is playing there in November,  and the tickets are only $55 for four.  but no one's a month for you.  I did see those tickies and I would be game and villain.  Yeah, $55 for floor stop.  Big big.  No, they're not big.  And that's right here.  They're probably big for a crawl like international.  Oh, and Sweden for sure.  Yeah.  For the big for them.  Box Swedish fish.  We love you.  I tried to put that come button all the time ago.  It just never worked.  Come.  Yeah.  Which wasn't clean.  It's unfortunate.  It is unfortunate.  But Avatar, fan of the pod, they are a fan of the pods.  This movie, Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  as we've said four times, came out in 1974.  You got that pre-crispin wah, pre-911.  It's directed by the one and only, Tob Hooper.  You got to Tob.  You and I actually watched Texas Chainsaw II together.  Yeah, movies.  It was fucking horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  You're horrible.  you say everybody just taking shots at me no I came up to an half no I showed mark an  autumn too and they're like well that was pretty pretty boring like your life is boring  alright it's movies great I mean mark is not a good indication of a movie's good or not  he has no this fuck you talking right but he also makes sing ones a lot that was also  two I also wrote for the funhouse my review there's honestly some good parts is film I  I did write that.  I'll take that.  So I can acknowledge it.  Jeff gave it a two and a half too.  The fuck Jeff, what's Jeff?  No?  Jeff, okay.  Yeah.  Films at home, which is no longer that.  Do you think you change it  because that's kind of a gay name?  Probably.  You want to go watch some films?  Jeff, we love you.  Yeah, being, I don't even speak to you.  Oh, I decide your DM's a while ago.  It's true when I first moved here.  And you took me on.  So you have to put me on a bull moose. So I have nothing but respect for that man. I mean it's getting the bag  I'm proud of him. Do you own this movie body bags or no? I do  I thought those John Carpenter though. It may either both credit as directors. Okay  Either way, he's a director. Tobe  And but it's just fun to say toad because silently. Yeah, it's very fun to say toad  We have here's your cast Marilyn Burns plays Sally. I don't think this is a question  Let it hype the fuck down.  We got Alan Danzinger.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  He plays Jerry.  Yikes to Bob Jerry.  Jerry's the guy with the glasses, right?  That was Jerry.  Kirk's the guy that's like young gravy.  Jerry's the guy Jerry.  Jerry, they keep begging to drive.  I never really got a good shot of his face,  but I probably, I'm not fucking him.  Nice, kind of got that weird hair that's like,  It's almost like a perm.  Bro's got a perm or something.  What kind of perm?  But everybody in this movie's also wearing bell bottoms?  Yeah.  And it's only good for women.  Yeah.  Fashion sense in 1974 is a little mid.  Sorry.  Yeah, it's fair.  So he's just gonna be a...  He ain't fucking it.  He ain't fucking it.  We got Paul A. Partain who plays the vegetable Franklin.  Yeah.  I mean, literally they call him invalid.  I was like like in the first opening crawl. Oh, do they yeah, they call him invalid and I'm like, you know what?  That's what we're gonna call them now  In valid they're not retarded they're invalid. Yeah, like yeah, I mean, that's almost worse, right?  You're invalid in life, bro. Yeah, you're invalid your vote doesn't count not the voting matters, but right. Yeah  He I mean, he's probably the most annoying character in the movie I would say  Yeah, his his death is also probably the best. So that's what I'm asking about that whichever question about later  William Vale man has no picture, but this is young gravy. Yeah, yeah young gravy in the flesh in the flesh  I would probably dig young gravy down, but not this guy this guy's climate skip  Yeah, cuz I was looking at his teeth and they were a little I thought they were like black for a minute  I don't know. Just wasn't it  He ain't fucking it  He ain't fucking it.  Next we got Terry McMen who plays Pam.  She could fucking Pam could fucking get it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I might have a question.  What the fuck is going on here?  Okay.  So Edwin Neal plays the hitchhiker.  Correct.  Now.  I was watching this movie and my phone was not in reach and I wanted to look up the cast list and Ed  Wanniel has a name on Google like his character has a name and it's Sawyer  That's that's the family's last name. Oh  Yeah, there's great and Sawyer is the that's the dad. That's daddy. Oh, he really just fucking hitchhiker. Yeah  Sorry to burst your bubble. No, I'm just fucking retarded sometimes  But it's always before I really got big until like you know  Cast and all that I always thought that chop top in  Texas chainsaw 2  Was the hitchhiker who was played by Bill Mosley and they're not the same character  And that really burst my bubble  He's also known what we call the American nightmare. You think that's Cody Rhodes  It probably is right. Oh, look at the fucking cast and this fucking thing  an examination of nature of 1967's horror films.  The involved artist.  It's fucking cool.  George Romero, Chanel Carpenter, Tom Savini,  David Croninver, Wes Craven, Tobe.  I'm out of breath already.  And then a bunch of irrelevant people.  You keep going down, Jim Lee Curtis is here.  Ron Cheney?  What? I thought he was dead.  Nick Castle?  Yeah, Nick Castle, Michael Myers himself.  He's came out in 2000, so yeah.  Anyways, Boris Carlisle, Martin Luther King,  Are Luther King Jr.?  It's probably clips of him in the movie.  RFK?  RFK or JFK?  R, not J.  R.  R.  Alright, next person I would cat.  Well, we're not fucking, I don't think we're fucking any of the Sawyer family.  That's for sure.  He ain't fucking it.  He ain't fucking it.  We got Gunner Hansen who plays the leather face.  I was old man like the old man.  Not fucking what's his name.  That's his dad.  That's his dad.  Dad is old man.  Yeah.  But his name is Drayton or no.  Like not in this one.  But later.  Later.  Because I need to know name for the scene by scene.  That's why I was that.  That's why I'm like.  It's called the old man.  No.  It's gonna get called Drayton because I wrote Drayton.  It's fine.  Or gas station attendant.  I was also what I wrote.  Dad, chef?  They call him chef?  Yes, chef.  You know them but a bitch hog.  Yeah.  We got John Duggan who plays the grandfather, not the godfather.  Like the wrestler or the movie.  Shadowed to the wrestler though.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, that guy's a legend.  He's got them hoes.  Yeah, he does got them hoes.  I don't think we need to shout anybody else here.  That's correct.  But I have no pictures.  So this franchise has, there's one good movie.  And it's this one.  Did you did it remake was good?  The remake, yeah.  I also like, so they did a legacy sequel  before a legacy sequel.  Mm.  They did Texas Chainsaw 3D in 2013.  I saw it in theaters with my father.  Shout out to it.  It was under age.  Tell me, like it here?  Yeah.  That's true.  I'm gonna use the word shit.  It was kidding.  Yeah.  but they did a legacy sequel and that movie is pretty  okay, but then they retconned it with the like,  was it Netflix Hulu or whatever?  I'm you in 2022.  Gonna wreck my cock on your ass.  I'm hoping I'm trying.  I don't know.  Can't get it up.  It's a problem.  But this is the only movie that's worth a damn  pretty much in the series.  And that's fine because it's a fucking classic for a reason.  Oh yeah it is. I mean we're recording today.  Should we say that? Yeah.  We're starting recordings today for horror months.  Get fucking ready.  And the recording study or this movie in house with thousand corpses.  And this back to back you can so obviously see the inspiration.  Oh yeah.  Like that. It's like so obvious.  Rob Zombie was a big fan.  1974 goddamn classic, which is this film.  If you're new to this podcast, we do a scene by scene.  So if you haven't seen the movie, go watch it or don't.  And you got to really bring yourself in.  Like 1974, there was really nothing out there like this.  Like this was pre-slasher, pre-halloween.  Like pre all of them.  You know?  So, bro, I'm telling you in 2025,  Where we send this podcast all the time that not much works and like we're desensitized this movie still disturbs me  Yeah for sure so sure acts  Oh my god the third act still holds up as movie was made fucking  50 years ago. Yeah very uncomfortable movie. Yeah for sure so like that's the good the great thing  They always say like less is more  You don't really see anything in this movie really no blood or  or gore or anything.  You might kinda want it.  Yeah, but I think that makes it scarier.  That's what I was gonna ask you though.  Like when Franklin gets murdered  on the remake they don't fucking show that,  the remake?  The remake's glorious shit.  Okay, that was 2003, like we're way past that.  No, I know, I'm just saying,  like I didn't know they were gonna intentionally keep it not.  Oh no.  Or they would show the gore.  I would have loved his friend to get fucking split open.  Yeah, you see his like blood splatter onto Leatherface, but he likes it.  No!  Alright.  We'll get into that.  We will.  Alright, so the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the film opens with a scroll which Dreyel so kindly  has the words to that and will dictate it to you.  I got it for you.  This film which you're about to see is an account of the tragedy which we fell a group of  five youths, in particular, Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin. We like youths.  Not all. I'm just kidding. It is all the more tragic in that they were young, but had they  lived very, very long lives. They could not be expected nor would they have wished to see  as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day. For them, an idyllic summer  afternoon drive became a nightmare. The events of that day were led to the discovery of one of  the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Hey, great. There's some camera flashes and we just see like a dead  dead person's hand and a shoe. This is a full-up fucking top. The camera flashes in every single  Texas Chainsaw movie. That exact sound. There's pulled the same clip.  I liked it.  Yeah, it's spoo for this movie. I liked it for the side one.  You know how to make it. Try and make it.  Goodie-y!  I'm just gonna let that one just leave the infinity turn already now.  Yeah.  Oops.  After that we get two bodies that are like kind of strapped together and they're like,  is this guy like straddling the grave or how are they fucking on or is that the cross?  like what how are they attached to this fucking grave? They're fucking dead. That's yeah, I mean, you know,  they just fucking skewered them on there. Yeah, I mean, I think you're led to kind of believe that  it was the race. The radio is talking about grave robbers too. That's something to keep in the back of your mind.  Just keep it back there because a character in this movie likes it.  Yeah, I like that.  He might be in a necrophilia.  Who knows, maybe he's fucking it.  He can be, but just remember, Billie ain't,  he ain't fucking it.  He ain't fucking it.  All right.  Janice, there's the credits.  I'll be honest, I fast forward through the credits.  And it was just like a fucking red, like pulsing screen.  It was like, yeah, whatever.  It's not like the Spider-Man 2 credits.  1974 low bunch super low budget. I don't know if you could tell here it put that bow. Yeah, of course  Yeah, I mean it takes place basically in one house  Yeah, it takes place on the side of the road a house and a gas station right yeah  After the credits we see a dead armadillo  this group of people pulls over and it's probably Kirk or Jerry. I don't fucking know one of them gets out of the van  to  Open the side door and put some planks out because Franklin who is a vegetable he was cursing a wheelchair  Chill and wheelchair  He has to get out because he's take a piss and he pees in a bucket. I don't know why you pea  He can't I guess you pee in your lap  Yeah, I thought the same thing. I'm like oh, I guess he just like piss on himself  So that's not good. Do you think you got it up?  Though you were fucking erect you could like shoot it over your like morning warrior like stand further back from the total  It's like a sprinkler at that point.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or just pissing the fucking Kirk's mouth  to save, you know what I mean?  Electricity?  I don't know.  Oh.  Why is he pissing a can though?  Pissing a bottle?  I don't know.  Yeah.  You think he dump it and then just bring it back with them?  Not so good.  No, I don't know if that fucking matters, but probably.  Yeah.  I'm never peed in a bottle or a can,  but I have jerked off into a can.  Right.  But I've also never peed in a bottle  I've never jerked off into a can proud of that one. Yeah, my dick's  Actually is bigger to not kid couldn't fit in a water bottle to say that. I don't think that average person can  Just the head but that's all you need just the tip my head is fucking huge  Yeah, but just a hole in the hole. Yeah, you know hold a whole action  You're good just to like where you where you want to sound yourself. That's where I would you have to fit it in there  Right exactly that's a cat  He's gonna come crazy right now.  Yeah, he jumped up on the cabinet.  And really, Twix is right here just chilling like that.  I'm just like,  something.  Subtext.  There she is.  Hey, Twix.  Anyways, so I don't really get this part, but I guess I've tracked her to her passes by and  like causes a gust of wind.  I thought he honked the horning, got scared.  Well, it knocked over Kirk too.  Yeah, but Kirk?  Yeah, it's true.  Maybe reread and have his fucking break on now  He didn't have his break on for sure  And you think he just tumbled down the hill and then like peed on himself too  He had to have right. Yeah. It's got it. It's got to be it's gotta be peed right  It's gotta be peed  It's gotta be had to find a way to put it in there, right? Yeah  Somehow just gonna stay. Yeah, just like rape had to find a way to put it in there  Wow, that's fucking terrible. Yeah, like that. I can keep that there. It's fine. We'll see in the end. I get soft in the edit.  Yeah, soft in the A on that one. Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's soft in the argument. I'm not one.  But it's cool because 1974 they really have stunned actors on a low budget. So homeboys  literally fallen down his cliff. You could have done a cliff.  It's cool as the vegetables go down a cliff. Yeah, you could have died in the movie would have been over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  so  the next cut they're driving and  Pam is talking about fucking horoscope which nothing pissing you off more than someone who fucking falls over some bullshit  Oh  Saturn's in retrograde like I don't fucking care. I don't even know what the fuck that means  If I couldn't tell you either, but it's probably bullshit. I think I don't know if I sat on this podcast or not  But I used to work with this guy who is now a day them, which is fine. You can be a day them. Sure  We respect everybody  He was like I bet I can guess your horoscope and I was like  Why is him fucking matter? He's like, let me guess it and I was like, okay?  And he's like, are you a Libra and I was like, yeah, he's like, oh my god, I fucking got  I go no matter fucking leaver you idiot and I walked away  What are you? I'm a Capricorn. Oh, I'm fucking your acknowledge it. I'm an Aquarius. Yeah, you are you are a queer. That's for sure. Right. I was gonna say I  Worked out  If you're an Aquarius or a queer or a Capricorn hit us up. Yeah, let us know we acknowledge all of them  We do but we just respect you a little bit less if you believe in horoscopes. Yeah, and even more actually god  I was gonna say I actually respect you more people even God in horoscopes. I think it's true  Yeah, yeah, well actually we might actually have to admit that we respect horoscopes more than God because at least horoscopes are based on planets  Which is somewhat scientific  That's very true  What are we gonna do?  I'm on team horoscopes. You're on team horoscopes. Fuck god  Yeah, right. Um, that's the other movie that has that God is not real or God is dead sign. It's not this one great  Anyways, so Sally wants to go make your grandpa's tomb has been untouched because of these grave robbers  And they go and it's got like grabbed by the fucking arms of your cum with a meat-acoustic your grandfather and then they know cares  different times I guess  Um, he's like, Hey, man, I hope I don't hope you don't mind. I'm stealing your girl for a second. I'm gonna go fuck her in the graveyard  Yeah, right on come on. We're grandpa grave. Oh, yeah  And her grandfather's grave was fine and they cut their back in the van again and there's a bad  MML you could answer just tell me some of the podcast  Jake you're on the two guys one screen podcast. Hello, Jakob  I was gonna try and name the movie you sent me a snap of.  All right, guess it.  With this, the second one.  You can read a snapchat.  Congratulations.  It's not the name of the movie.  Also, I don't think it's a mischief.  Yeah.  Hey, man, I thought maybe that was the name.  No.  But she had the capture spalding.  Yeah.  Hey, great.  You say goodbye?  Yeah, he did.  Cut over.  Our local G. ladies and gentlemen.  local. Yeah. I mean, the relative. He's closest to you to me. Yeah. I don't know. You're the  Jew that I know is my uncle. Seems closer than Jake is to me. Yeah. I meant location wise, but  all right. Jason Jersey. Oh, closer. Okay. I think Jake's jig's little is the closest Jew to me  that I know of relative to location.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you were like close to me emotionally.  No, but no,  you've been able to break the walls down yet.  The most walls.  So Jake.  Yeah, Jake has broken down every wall.  Jake now has less hair than Chris Jericho.  That's not a competition.  Are you talking about Chris Jericho now?  Because that means balding too.  He got the longer to cover it up.  Exactly.  Smart.  Jeez, I got a hippie ponytail and and Jericho's got a better beard. Sorry and Jericho's got a looking Jericho's got a great bod  Jericho's a good go you are not around now  Yeah, he's  working not  so they're passing this fucking slaughterhouse and  Franklin was all about this fucking slaughterhouse and how they used to kill the sludge hammer now that he's a gun and  And they stopped to pick up this hitchhiker who is,  I wrote a fucking drug addict.  I mean, why would you stop to pick this guy up?  Well, yeah, they even say it.  They're like, oh, hitchhiker,  we should pick that guy up, right?  Yeah, no, this is back in a time where I guess it was normal.  This is, but this is like one of the movies that like set up like,  hey, in a horror movies, which make bad decisions.  It's true.  And then everyone would follow him.  It was like, we're gonna also do this.  Modern times we technically have hitchhiking but it's monitored like uber  We also have hitchhiking I mean I've seen people on the street  Like thumbs up like hey pick me up. I would never fucking do that fuck no. Absolutely not  So he says that this drug addict guy hitchhiker says that his family  That his family worked at slaughterhouse and me has always been in his family man's fucking caring meat  I mean killing me and I mean this guy's this guy's you know super reery, but so he's so he's probably packing  You think this dude's slinging dick actually honest. Yeah, I don't hate that he probably slinging dick  I mean leather faces for sure that's a big boy  Yeah  And boy cuz he's only 20 in this movie. I guess he's probably carrying some meat. I don't look at him and think big cock  But he probably had a big cock. Yeah  Let us know what you think.  And the pitch-eye grid is not like the fact  they're using the guns now for cattle  because it's put people out of jobs.  But he saw us have pictures.  They show them of all the cows he murdered.  They're just in his pocket.  I don't even think he murdered them.  I think he snuck in there and took pictures.  Didn't one of them was in the background?  One of them were my making that up.  Selfie in 1974, the first one,  he definitely was not in.  And the second one, it was a cow like on a table.  I thought there was a person standing behind it.  Oh, could you wait?  No, I don't know.  I could be wrong.  You don't really get to see good image of the pictures.  I would agree with that.  And then he talks about how to make head cheese.  You ever have it?  No, but I know it's still a thing.  Yeah, I Google it, Boris had sells it.  Yeah, I mean, if you're into that kind of thing.  No, it's like the remnants of their heads.  Yeah, they just boil it.  I'm good, dog.  Yeah, but I do like dick cheese.  Yeah.  And you can like, give me head while I'm eating cheese.  Like, that's the oil.  Oh, my God.  Well, Franklin likes head cheese too.  Head cheese is probably also what you can,  you could just call a dick cheese head cheese  because that cheese grows in your head.  That's true. That's true.  But that's not all you know.  That's for all you motherfuckers that's still got hoodies  on your cocks.  Yeah.  That's not edible though.  I mean you could see anything's edible if you try. That's true. So I mean some they argue head cheese probably shouldn't be a  Yeah, I mean I would if I know what it was I'd be like this kind of weird. I'm even trying this  I mean nowadays it's probably like really like preserved and like safe  Yeah, but bet there's like French fucks like you know. Oh my head cheese  I'm not even a  Presued head cheat why they could have done them  Yeah, they're just fucking eating head shell or stroking a guy off that has that cheese right while the  Who's this fucking mommy?  The s-car go over there, so I keep thinking it's a mommy to same fucking lady. You ever have s-car go?  Actually, I have not hmm. I don't know  I don't think I'm interested in it. Snails are one of my most hated creatures on the planet  So yeah, definitely not but you're definitely trying to slurp up Sally's snail trail right thousand percent. Yeah, just fucking to look it off the ground  Yeah  I want to make that a sound one  Man when he's going after all that NDA's oh  So for some reason they picked this guy, I guess Franklin is playing with his pocket knife paws  but but I guess he probably just pulled it out. Whoa.  Oh, the defend himself probably because this guy looks like.  No, because you know earlier he was like picking under his nails with it.  Mmm. Well, he's fucking idiot for just holding a knife out and this junkie just takes a knife right out of his hand.  Uh, and he starts gashing his own palm, which is.  I mean, it's not something a normal person of sound mind would do.  I don't know if I've ever sounded myself or intentionally cut myself.  I don't know why you think I don't know if I've done it.  I think you should know.  No, I've definitely never sounded myself.  She's like, oh, there was that one time I can't tell if I was a dream or not.  There was a chartered last going in my pee hole.  Yeah, I've definitely never done that.  But I don't know if I've actually, if I've ever purposely cut myself.  I expect your palm is gnarly.  I feel like there's something major in there, right?  He's gotta be tain.  You can't.  You can't fucking wrap that nice though.  Where'd the fucking button go?  Why did a fade off like that?  I don't know.  Give us a button, dammit.  That's gotta be, that's gotta be tain.  Thank you.  Thank you, Vince.  But you can't like, you saw it.  You can't wrap that nice.  So it stitched it.  You can stitch it and flick it.  I don't know.  You'd have to glow it.  You'd have to fucking snap it shut.  Yeah.  People get their palms tattooed.  That's gotta hurt.  I mean, anything on the hand as far as tattoos  concern is crazy to me.  We're crazy.  This lady that I work with and granted,  like you have to use your hands in the kitchen.  So they're gonna get worn down or if you're a hooker.  But she got a butterfly right here in the crevice  of like where your thumb and your index finger are.  That is a nice spot.  You have a, why would you not in the kitchen?  Not if you're using your hands a lot  because it's gonna fade over time.  that skin's gonna get worn the fluff down.  And then she got a fucking, right above the tit,  just says her name.  Why y'all getting your names tattooing your buys?  You don't fucking know your name?  Her own name?  It, what is she?  Hispanic?  That's why.  Aah, yeah.  It's sad.  Well, that's actually her name, no bullshit.  No bullshit bro, I just wanna say  what's the point where we have a typical Hispanic law name.  I also did work with this guy who had his whole name,  like full government name tattooed down his arm  and he had like waves crash behind it.  Are you?  What are you doing?  What do we do?  See that?  I'm all four tattoos get whatever you want.  That's fucking dumb.  Yeah.  I mean, your whole, I would ask him like most the time  because I always soft medists.  It's like, oh, it's like some kind of like oceanic,  like partial seaman I got finished.  And then one day I actually looked at it  and it fucking just said his name.  I was like, what the fuck is this for?  I was like, do you have so many fake green cards?  That's you can remember you were a man.  Oh, he was Hispanic too.  Not at all.  Yeah, I mean, the people I work with are not white.  I guess.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't got like Germans or fucking  against waves on a dark person is crazy.  Well, the problem is also like, it's a problem.  It's not a problem.  It's not a problem.  Probably the dark people getting tattoos  is the high criminal.  I can't fucking see him.  Oh, probably a crew.  Oh.  So this man fucking cuts his palm and he just laughs about it and gives Franklin his knife  back and then he has another knife at the readiness sock.  It's like one of those old school razors to like shave reviews.  Yeah.  It's a nice one.  I'd be scared.  He shows it to young gravy's like, hey, put that shit back, bro.  Okay, put that shit back in the trunk while I fuck your mom.  Then he decides to just take a photo of him  and it's like one of those old fashioned photos  that's like a Polaroid, but it's bigger.  Yeah, like, yeah.  Yeah, Polar drone.  And he's like, oh, you guys need to drop me  off my house, live right over there.  And he's like, you can commit for dinner.  And then he's like, I want $2 for the picture I just took.  And like, why would we pay you for a photo we didn't ask for?  Right. Uh, and it is not going to pay him. So he lays out some like foil and fucking like powder. Yeah, like lights is fucking picture on fire.  So obviously I don't want to fucking fire in their van and apparently cutting your own palm open isn't weird enough to get kicked out of the van, but lying the picture on fire was last strong. They're like, okay, right.  The fuck that's also cuts Franklin. Correct. They're freaking out about the fucking fire. He fucking cuts Franklin's arm. Yeah. Like that would be  All that cut was I mean I got it's 1974 not that bad no  He should went down his arm further  He should have started like an album fucking drag that shit well they probably ran out of Heinz ketchup  That's fair  Let me look at the budget while you keep going so they're all like Jerry pull over  Jerry, Jerry stop gluice  Jerry, please  and they cut  He cuts Franklens on like you said, and after they all like kind of recuperate fucking  Pam has talked about horoscopes again how Franklens isn't looking so hot, but like fucking you have courts  It's not because that should just flexes to whatever you need to be  So the budget is not 100% but it was less than a hundred thousand  okay  they  Stop at a gas station  and they asked the attendant who was like the old man where the old Franklin house is and  And to be fair, this guy, I mean I know he's fucking unhinged.  Right, he did tell him like you don't wanna be going there.  I don't know if he's leaving.  Like, he's a bad guy, but he's like the least bad out of all of them.  Yeah, I guess. I mean he did have a doctor girl.  That's pretty bad. I mean I guess...  I kinda wanna say like, leather face is the least mean,  cause he doesn't know any better.  Special dee?  He's fucking unhinged bro, kid's unhinged.  Yeah, but he's just doing what his dad tells him, right?  Do you think he killed those like as each person enter the house?  He just fucking killed them.  There was no one there being like,  hey, go kill them.  He just got it.  They got it.  Like you said,  like you said, he retarded.  We don't know.  Right.  Yeah.  You don't know.  He's just doing shit.  He's probably just protecting his house and uh oh.  But he was texting it with a chainsaw.  But here's the thing.  He's a fucking mohoming human,  but he does recognize his family.  Right.  He's a,  yeah.  You know,  he's got that going for him.  He tries to talk.  He kind of does like, he's maybe he's Italian  because he's talking and screaming at some of his hands.  He's trying, licking his lips.  So I mean, all I'm saying is this old man  does warn them, but you probably shouldn't be going over there  because you're gonna get eaten.  Yeah, bad shit to learn.  And frankly, like my father owns it,  which I don't know what happened to Franklin's father,  but he definitely had not been this building for a long ass time.  And the old man offers them barbecue.  you have barbecue inside and they pick some up and I were led to believe they eat it.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's human. Yeah, it's human for sure. No, it's definitely human.  Yeah, it's firm. It's fucking human. Then there's a next scene of driving the car and Franklin  asked Kirk if he would cut himself like that like the hitchhiker did. The Kirk was like,  fucking, no, you're fucking, where are you feelings? You want to cut your hair off?  Are you cut vertically horizontally for attention results?  Yeah, vertically for results.  I think I'll lay in the bathtub.  Fuck yeah.  We're just doing toaster.  It's easy.  So I didn't read the scene by scene right,  but I pick up the barbecue and Sally notices  the blood on the outside of the van.  Next thing they pull up to.  I mean, a weird symbol on the van.  to Franklin's house.  And they made a funny joke that looks like Bella  logos he's birthplace, which, hey, respect your elders.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But by elders, that movie was only like what?  30 years before?  Yeah, but they're your elders.  Damn, you think Dracula was already a classic in 74?  Probably, right?  I would say it's gotta be.  It's gotta be awesome.  It's gotta be true.  Yeah.  Dracula?  Yeah.  I mean, I know it's a classic.  It is now for sure.  I mean, yeah.  Well, what, what mean?  We call the Incredibles a classic, right?  Oh, God, that was 20 years ago.  20 years ago.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, like just,  certain movies are our classics.  I don't know if you're already.  I think over some people like criticisms today  are like an instant classic.  You see it's a fucking three star. Well like get out is like a horror classic now  Well, you know, we'll be a classic yeah modern horror classic  We'll be look back at as a classic yeah and hereditary or the most recent ones I think goes  Yeah, that's  Yeah, I mean I think some people I think we both don't agree with this but some people would say nope  Yeah, I don't like that movie not now you took it's fine. Move me to find movies. It's not a masterpiece  Yeah, I mean and also you're also you have it's in the movie, but I don't agree with it people are gonna say centers  Mm-hmm like ten years. I'm like yes centers with that fun movie. I yeah, fortunately  Spoiler alert over on that shelf you bought it. Yeah, I bought a  kid dude  Yeah, watch the max first. Well, you bought a 4k. I did that in Thunderbolts  You bought thunderbolts? Yeah, I still look or what no  I don't have Disney plus anymore fuckers going on anymore  Okay, she wants the floor and pews tits which by on in that movie because it's Disney. Yeah, it's PG 13  Yeah, well cuz I didn't want to only buy one thing  Because I bought honestly, that's fair. I'm not gonna spoil it. I guess I'll spoil it anyway. I bought the ace Ventura 4k steel book  Well, that I knew was gonna that was a steal. Yeah  They had a steal. I was okay. Sorry, but I saw that a Walmart. I'm like fuck am I so get this and  And I was just staring at him like  Whatever fuck it you're gonna fucking sell that back and fucking do once maybe I don't know maybe I'll watch  Want to open tomorrow? I'll probably I'll be honest thunderbolts probably not getting watched  Yeah, I  Unless we do the MC you you're not gonna watch it. Yeah, sinner's for sure I need to watch  I  Gave it a three and a half I just think the four and a half five star movies is just kind of a grass  I mean, it's probably like to get out and nope thing, right?  It's about black people and horror.  So, instant classic.  Black Panther, instant five out of five instant classic.  Yeah, I, I, can't I mean?  I don't know how to say my thoughts out.  It sounded like a racist.  So I'm just not either.  So I just said it.  Yeah, I'm just, well, I'm just not gonna say,  because it's just like, yeah.  Anyways, back is where it has only white people in it.  So, that's true.  No, black guy at the very end.  Truck truck driver is a black. Yeah, and it has like fucking black mumb on his truck, too  You look like you just buried out of like some black exploitation movie  yeah  So they leave Franklin by the car to clean the blood off of it and  He's like staring at it thinking that means something and then he can't find his knife  We cut to a Kirk and I really hear his noises  I think it's just the girls laughing, but they laugh for like way too fucking long. Yeah. They're in this abandoned house  Just for no fucking reason just to hang out. I guess yeah, they're not documenting anything  They're not like they were like fucking cameras cuz even like Sally's like oh I slept here when I was a kid  I slept around. What do you got fucking big gulp?  You went to 7-11. I don't know where she went, but you got big gold. They go don't have me 7-11's in your hair  Got a big girl cup  I feel like a big girl. I feel like that was my goat milk. Yeah  I don't know I store that bitch's bush and then gave she gave me big gulp  Gllup, Gllup  So Kirk walks in this fucking room and in a corner. There's only just it's just spiders. There's like day long legs or what I  I don't know they were fucking terrifying if you saw that if you saw that many spiders  I'm running right I'm out. I'm not on trial. I want  Also, why am I not building like that anyways?  Yeah, I think I was in one one one  Probably cut that name, but  Fuck that kid if you're listening. He wanted if he wanted my help filming a music video  I always really about saying let's hear something a music video why you did abandoned building  I mean, that's what it was.  And it was literally, go ahead.  It was like low key almost on school grounds,  back in the woods, way back in the woods,  there was an abandoned house.  Like, not, okay, I know what you're talking about.  I'm being retarded.  Sorry.  So I had the video come out like shit.  I never fucking watched it.  Did you like hold the camera for him?  Yeah, right, it's getting bars.  Yeah, I didn't want to be in there. I'm like, yo, this is just trash. This is literally illegal.  Yeah, I did it. That's why I did it. I did it. Yeah.  That's probably the worst thing I've ever done in my life.  illegal.  Franklin is trying to call for the group, but they're not coming down to them.  Finally, they come down and Kirk and Pam want to go swimming.  And Frank was like, yeah, just down that way a little bit  because Frankly and used to live there, I guess.  Sounds like we could've fallen around it.  Down the trail between the mons of the old water hole.  I can't move my legs.  How am I gonna get my legs up?  I'll never get touched by a woman again.  I can't feel when I have to poop.  I wonder if you're, bro, I'm thinking, right?  If you're paralyzed from like the waist down,  you don't have feelings.  How do you feel when you have to take a shit?  You've made such a drops.  Oh my God.  Like how do you know you had to take a piss?  No, I feel like you would feel your stomach churned,  and no, your stomach, you probably still have feelings.  But you can, you, yeah, but most of the time,  when I have to poop, I feel it like in my anus, you know?  That's true.  Oh, so you're thinking you can't fly your anus out.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, can any cappy will not get erections?  I don't know.  That's blood flow.  Right.  Which, they still have blood flow.  Yeah, because like if blood didn't flow their legs,  they would just like fucking harden and fucking die.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they would just like have blood flow.  So it's literally just the feeling.  But also we're not doctors.  So we probably don't know what the fuck we're talking about.  Should we call my sister?  Yo.  Should we?  No.  If somebody starts getting tired.  If somebody starts getting tired.  Yeah, should we not work?  That's fine.  You're lying on the show guys once you read the podcast.  I mean if she's at work she won't, she will answer the phone.  Yeah.  What she do nowadays?  She's at, she's at ER nurse.  Oh nice.  That's, that's, that's, which is where this fucking movie takes place.  Hey!  That's actually a really good job.  Yeah, she's doing well.  She's doing good.  I don't know where this is.  What town is this in?  I know a town she works and what, I was like, what the fuck why she's in that?  She's just fucking me.  Oh yeah, she's at work, she's on the answer.  All right.  Anyways, if for some God forsaken region  in this podcast, let us know.  Or if you're a fan and you know some of medical stuff.  Or if you're dick can't get up  cause you're paralyzed cause you're a paralyzed.  You're a  If someone fucking, who got paralyzed in WWE?  If you've got Stone Cold, you know?  I was gonna say Owen Harper, he's dead.  He's dead.  I mean, he did it to Stone Cold.  Yeah, he did do it Stone Cold, you're right.  Oh, hit.  Oh, hit.  No pussy, libina, guy.  Nice.  No.  Yeah, he got me.  Steve, Steve Austin's packing for sure.  No doubt he's packing.  Yeah.  So they go to look for this fucking swimming hole  and Jay and Sally are still in the upstairs.  And then Franklin turns around and finds  like a weird pile of bones slash feathers, skull,  something else.  Teef, teeth.  And he calls for Sally, and then it cuts,  and Kirk and Pam can't find something whole.  God, there's dried up.  It dry up.  And I guess they get lost.  I don't know, I just don't get why you're walking  to the fucking back with the text is like that.  This is kind of suspect to me.  Cause they need gas cause homeboy didn't have gas.  So they see the building.  How we didn't have any gas?  No.  I don't remember that.  Okay.  That's why they walked to the Sawyer house  because Dick Wodg, young gravy fine,  like here's the generators.  He hears generators and he's like,  gas!  It's gotta be gas, right?  That's gotta be gas.  It's gotta be kidding!  Came like fire.  This is gonna become a very annoying bit  Now that I have that button,  I'm just gonna fucking use it whenever I need to use it.  Can you play a good leather face?  I would agree with that.  Stay tuned for a CNOE overview.  Sorry.  I mean, you're gonna buy a time that actually comes out.  You're gonna forget we even said it.  It's right to you.  Yeah.  Anyways, it's probably game.  It's probably game.  Yeah, so impressive.  They get lost and they find like a barn.  It looked like a barn that had like cars,  which I'm guessing these are cars  because the families killing people  and just storing their cars in this area.  Because dad's got a trip.  And Kirk's like a generator.  That means gas.  It's like that one sponge bob thing I can reference.  It's a rock, but it's a generator.  Right. This is probably where the,  this probably we're dead by daylight  got the inspiration for generators.  I don't know what dead by daylight even means.  That's a game.  It's like a horror game,  but like games don't got it.  but like a bunch of horror people are in it.  Like Jason, not Jason, Freddie, Chuckie, scream.  It's cute.  So is this house near this barn?  Yeah.  They knocked on their barn.  It's fucking wild.  They knock on this goddamn door and no one answers.  And then Kirk's like, I'm just gonna go inside.  It did be fair and Pam's not for it.  That's true, but she,  but he also finds like a molar just sitting on the porch.  Just picks it up and then gives it to Pam. It is funny just different time  If I saw the tooth, I'm running that's already a bad sign. I'll my fucking tooth. I'm out  That's your pride  Yeah, you got that crack yeah, I'm just bit of crack rot  Cracked run before you  Oh, a crack rock.  They sitting there like, yeah, this is a fuck or two.  Two.  Hey, don't crack.  Oh, crack.  Oh, crack.  I smoked this shit.  You weren't.  Yeah.  You got that enamel, bro.  Let me pass that in.  You have a smoke that fucking enamel.  Um, so he just walks in.  Your opens.  He just walks in.  It's like a bones hanging up and shit, which I thought of a conversation we had at  at some point about how like certain people like your brother like the fucking boiled bones and hang on the wall.  So I guess this is not weird but for me it'd be weird.  No it's me it'd be weird to walk into somebody's home but well yeah but it's also weird in this scenario because it's human bones as opposed to like you know.  Yeah but you like the shot when the door opens and you just see like straight down the hallway and the door shifts.  Those bones I couldn't tell they were like human or an animal.  No, because if someone mounts a deer skull on the wall, you can clearly tell it's a deer skull.  You don't fuck them out a deer skull.  That's what it's called, bro. You can throw it in deer.  Yeah, bro. Give that 8 pointer, right in my fucking gooch.  Fuck my gooch.  So, Kirk goes in.  You know that step that we're still stuck on Kirk going inside, but you know, I go ahead.  You know that scene you were just talking about?  The red wall with all the bones. Yeah, I remember I have that as a door cover  It's scared you that one time. I don't remember it, but sure. Oh, you're like, yeah  Whether you're gonna fucking penny wise thing you had, but yeah, you're like, yeah, leather face is gonna be staring at me on my I'm like, yeah  Was that in Jersey or was that was here Jersey? Yeah, I don't remember it though. Okay, you're probably too drunk  Okay  No, no, that's it.  Is it stinking right?  I mean, you fucking drunk.  I should say, tell you puked my track.  That's because I puked, I puked in your ex's bowl.  So fuck her in that bowl.  Yeah, fuck that bowl.  Yeah.  It's only because I was drinking beers  that you didn't like, which I thought you were  because it was pumpkin flavored.  Yeah.  Because you love pumpkin flavor shit, but.  Yeah.  Oh, so spicy season bitch.  Yeah, spooky season beer that you didn't fucking like.  And then you bought those fucking little cheap fucking bottle of liquor and I took one and I just shot it.  Oh yeah.  It doesn't good.  Yeah.  And not just like, why would I drink liquor after beer? You don't do that.  Not just other way.  You're in the clear.  Yeah.  Son of a bitch.  All right.  Either way.  So he's in the fuck a hallway.  And there's bone tang on the walls we said.  And the subtitle said pig squealing.  That was the noise.  Was a pig squeal.  I'm pretty sure his leather face.  I'm just telling you, I'm just telling you the subtitles on my screen.  That's what it's that's what it said.  Hey, maybe when they made this Blu-ray they had it sent out to a third party to do the subtitles  for it and they just wrote pigs going there.  Fuckin wrong.  It was a human.  And he's like going in through an ex doorway and he trips and like Lou bumps framed a  I love your face who decides to bash his head with a fucking mallet and hammer.  Yeah, probably.  That's like a goat jump scare, right? It's an OG jump scare.  I mean, I definitely didn't see it coming because there's no, there's no like  had a soundtrack. No, no music.  And then there's like this little metal door because he bashes his head in.  And it's like this kill is so like visceral because the guy's like sitting  like like he's shaking. Yeah. You need drags him in this metal door slam shot. And then  pams like Kirk. Cause she's sitting on her. She's sitting on one of those like swing chairs.  Yeah. And I'd say outside the house. Yeah. I'll say a very iconic shot when the camera  follows her underneath the, it goes underneath the swing and follows her ass. They  They had other ass shots when they were getting the Coca-Cola that went about the machine  at the gas station.  Just like, you're straight fucking ass.  This is a very famous shot.  So she goes inside and I think that because the door is open, the room is like illuminated.  And then the door wants to close because it was dark and she like stumbles through some  curtains that unveil a room that's like full of just bones, feathers and there's one  chicken in a cage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they have like this skeleton setup decorating a couch,  like just human bones, like accenting the shape of a couch. That's what Ed Gein would do.  You made like lamp shades out of like human skin lamp shades. All right. This fucking thing.  Oh yeah. They were skulls. What are you doing? You psycho?  So she's like fucking nauseated by this and she starts like not crying,  Like oh, I've been like oh my god. And then she gets chased by  Leatherface and she like just makes it out the front door. But gets fucking snatched  And I remember she gets skewer on this hook or would she just like clip by her clothes?  I thought she uh, she skewered  Think so? Yeah, she didn't sell it very well  1974 it was also no because no no no because Sally sells the fuck out of her performance  This girl doesn't do shit  I mean I want it to be skewered because that's more brutal but it would probably go through her now  Right but right on the budget  Yeah, I don't know by the way, she gets put on this fucking meat book  It's not your bag meat-hooky guy because my conch is kind of curved. Is it?  No, I just was trying to be funny. It's not really cool. It's like that. It does lean. Oh  Yeah, my leads to less. Yeah, mine right now is leaning to the right  just ahead. Mine's actually kind of curved right now.  That's kind of smushed because I'm fat.  Fair. We come back to Franklin, Jay and Sally  and they're like waiting and Jay's like I'm fucking sick of it and he's gonna go out.  He goes out looking for him and Franklin thinks that this  blood and the van means something and it's like a symbol  and he's still concerned they've lost his knife.  And this is just where Franklin's just kind of bitchy and kind of complains a lot  But he does keep for warging a Sally and she's like Franklin I'm fucking tired, bro  so jay's looking for for fucking Kirk and  He kind of walks in same trailer rives at the same house from before  And he enters this room where Kirk was I missed it. Oh  And he got oh hey, we talked about the fucking meat hook and then I skipped it. Yeah, I completely skipped it  But she's on that fucking meat skewer and then leather face turned the fucking chains on and I  I'm assuming it's a decapitation.  Yeah, it kind of turns his head.  Yeah, mama he.  Yeah, ball head black head mama hit mama.  Hey, go with no Friday 13th episode.  Fuck punk in boy.  You're on that.  Fucking head pumpkin boy.  Head out of boy.  So Kirk does the exact same thing.  He knocks a door.  And then he enters and finds his room where Kirk was just murdered.  But nobody's jerking it.  No one's in there.  And there's some knocking on the chest freezer.  And he opens in his lady pops out.  But as she pops out, little face pops in,  saw the fucker out.  And he shoves the lady back in the freezer.  We cut in its nighttime and Franklin Sally are still waiting.  I thought the lady was Pam. No?  No, cuz she's not on the hook anymore. She didn't I also thought that but she didn't look like Pam to me  But I'm also retarded so I don't I don't know that's what I have in my notes  I'll just you know I mean it would make sense because you don't know what happens to Pam. Mm-hmm  It's gotta be Pam  It's gotta be I had the button in a minute. I just want to see if there is  Yeah, I guess it's Pam. Yeah, right?  Skyby Pam  So, so I want to go looking for him in Franklin's like no, and they start calling for Jerry.  Jerry?  He ain't coming.  Jerry?  Jerry.  And Franklin wants to take the car and go to the gas station so he wheels around to the other  side of the car to haunt the horn and realizes that either Kirk or Jay or whoever took  the keys, probably Jerry because Jerry was driving the car.  Yay, fucking was.  So it sounds like I'm going looking for him. You need to fucking flash like and Franklin refuses  It's just like fighting for the flashlight still can't get it out of his hands  And so I'm going without it and Franklin's like I'll go with you now  I'm decided to go with you and  I'm fucking pushing you. Yeah, but towards the end of that scene. She like turns around and grabs him and pushes him in the very next scene  She's fucking they're just churning through this goddamn like slop  You're just a fucking slap land.  It's not a cornfield, but big cornfield vibes.  And there's no clowns in it.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  Some shows are yet.  I do want to watch it.  Where they run into leather face who  God's Franklin with a chainsaw.  Texas chainsaw, massacre.  Right, but we only see one person get killed by a chainsaw.  I guess two if you count Kirk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So is this seen in the remake?  Is it, it's a glorious fucker now?  It's not like a shot for shot remake.  That's good.  Yeah.  Does the guy in the fucking way if you're getting gutted  though or what?  I don't think there's a guy in a wheelchair.  Oh, that's fucking ableist.  Yeah, good.  It hinders the character.  Sally goes running for a fucking life.  And she's like in the woods.  And then she comes, I think what they were trying to show here,  She gets kind of lost in the woods and he gets turned around and then ended in front of this house  The house the house because she's like I got a guy out of the wood. I don't want poison ivy on my clown  I want to get  I want my plan  I want my bean agravert like Elizabeth. Yeah, cuz she flick her shit. I want it itch my shit. She flicked her shit too much  Yeah, I don't want to get fucking snatched like an evil dead  Yeah, fuck my I'm fine fuck my much my fucking tree  fucking tree.  Not it!  Oh, that ain't your tree, I just the con!  Oh, my God!  That's a quad dick!  That's a quad dick!  Crazy!  Yeah, that, yeah, that he's a big dick.  Yeah, that's a compliment.  That wasn't racist.  Great.  So she runs in this house, closes the front door and runs upstairs.  Let me see, let her face start chains on the front door, which is gonna come back to  buy him in the fucking ace.  And she runs upstairs and finds two...  I mean, I wrote dead people, but I guess one of them's not dead.  Grandpa, live for real for real.  He alive and she sees them and obviously freaks her out.  She runs back downstairs, but this point,  Leatherface is broken back into the house.  That means he's coming out from within the house.  He's in house. All he had to do is open the door.  He's a fucking mohomean, yoyman.  And instead of opening the door, he just fucking takes on it down.  It's not trespassing because you live there.  Right.  And there's no one there to shoot you and say, get off my lawn.  Right. But your in Texas, that would happen.  That's that sad reality. Yeah.  Uh, so she gets chased and I cannot emphasize enough how much this lady runs this  movie and how much she screams and the screaming really solves the movie.  Yeah, she sounds terrified.  I don't want to say this, but she kind of killed me with her fucking back.  Yeah.  A little bit.  I mean, do you think I mean, do you think?  No, I mean, I like the war behind like the soldier family.  But if you have a bad actress here, it's not going to be as scary as it is.  I would agree with that.  I mean, how long they spent like in the next act of like with her just strapped to  chair.  I mean, torturing her.  Yeah.  I mean, that like I don't if you had a bad actress, it wouldn't have sold.  I don't know.  I think that's why some of the song always come off as like, yeah, that's whatever because like.  Oh, oh god.  Yeah.  Oh, it's like that guy Novakane.  He can't show anything.  Just like, oh, oh, it hurts.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Go listen to our Novakane review or Dell.  It's good.  Move.  All right.  And nobody came.  We talked about no white way longer than that than fucking.  Okay, Novakane.  Novakane doesn't get.  Yeah.  Good.  So she runs this gas station, the old man is there and she's a call of fucking police right now. Also, if I run to a gas station, freak the fuck out and there's an old man grabbing my entire face.  Like he's like this to her. Like he's probably like, probably like, oh, he's like fucking scooter.  right yeah and I like  Rey Mysterio fucking believe  I thought that was real  fuck like kill Rey Mysterio  like he's got to be dead  yeah it was gotta be dead  that kills your eyes me as a kid  I was like he's dead  hey I get it I mean that was  like yeah proper fucking yeah  like I thought any I thought Eddie was  actually Dominic's dad. Wait, hold on a second stop. Is Dominic related to right or not? Yeah,  it's his son. Okay, good. That's not a fake thing. No, it's not. Okay. But they have like a  custody of a bad old thing. Yeah, right. I could see his being a bit. Okay. All right, good.  So he's trying to come around but she's fucking hysterical and he's like, I'm going to get my truck.  And he mentioned.  Children something like that am I making that up?  He definitely said something like that.  And I was like, what are you talking about?  Cause.  But they don't have a phone.  How do you know how to phone in a gas station?  Well, I guess we know what.  What is that before?  They also he wouldn't need to call him.  No, because you're going to eat them.  Right.  And this is where it confirms our selling human barbecue,  because she looks over at this fire pit.  And it has like a full chest piece.  Yeah, I mean you're sitting there.  Yeah.  You know, you go to KFC, get the four piece.  You go to this place, you get the chess piece.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's true.  Yeah.  So he can return with a truck and he comes out holding  the burlap sack in a rope.  And this is like terrifying.  Actually.  And she starts like breaking down.  She's like, you can't show next to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So she grabs a knife and this was kind of silly.  He beat her with a broom.  He does just grab a fucking broom.  Oh, shit out of her.  Yeah.  But he does, you look the fucking stick to choke her out.  Oh, yeah.  After it breaks in a different way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not like sticking to a stick down and throwing.  He's like taking this fucking broom and like  just broke her up.  Like splinter stick.  Yeah.  It's big splinter.  Yeah.  And then he had them tying her up.  He fucking flips her over.  He was getting off to this.  You can't tell me he wasn't.  He was.  But then he like kind of, he did like the whole police thing,  right?  Put your hands behind your back.  Yeah.  Let me get my dick on your ass and then the entire hands up.  Right.  He was into it. He was definitely into it.  And he ties her up. He sticks her cloth or mouth.  I don't even laugh at that much.  She's trying to wear a road.  He fucking gags her. It's all right.  He just can't get shit. You know, it just went wrong.  It's just like that. What was the, what's the king?  Could you see it more at time?  What was the king constraining during that she wanted?  And when they were in the bedroom?  Oh, well, you don't like, got me and like, don't say no.  Oh, it was like right me. You just fucking do it in a while.  What fucking do you want to just rape me?  And he's like, ah, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, by the way, on the topic of strange  drawing really quickly, that movie weapons is out.  And because like this recording is coming out sooner,  weapons is a good fucking movie,  but to all you fucking that are dismissing strange  drawing because of the narrative structure.  Oh, it's so obvious, but then you like weapons.  Shut the fuck up.  Really, literally shut your fucking whore mouths.  It's the same shit.  It's the same exact fucking shit.  It's not played out the same way,  but the way they're like,  this is the story from so and so's perspective.  And then this is like,  God, I don't wanna fucking hear it.  Because then it's like,  they do chapter four,  which brings you to chapter two or whatever.  And then, they do all that kind of shit.  And then in weapons, it's almost the same thing.  And people are like, oh, weapons is so great.  Yeah, well, strange jollings is also fucking great.  And fuck you.  Hey, movies are all subjective. So it doesn't really fucking matter if you were offended by what I just said or not.  I should be offended by what I just said. Yeah. I mean, I'm also not, you know, not opposed to sucking strange darling's dick.  Fucking love that movie. We fucking great. You're all fucking rock. They're saying, they're saying weapons is better.  People, I'm saying weapons is a good movie. I gave weapons of four. I gave strange line that could four and a half. Yeah.  They're just comparing them. They're just  What I'm saying is people leave weapon giving weapons like a five star or a four and a half rating because of the structure and then you  Right they applaud it in the in their reviews and then you look at their reviews for strange darling and it's like a three or two and a half  It's like bro, come on like what are you doing cuz also?  spoiler alert weapons is not a horror movie. I'm gonna fuck what anybody says  No, I don't even care if you go see it. You tell me to horrible. I don't even fuck. It's not okay  There's two little tiny scary parts and that's okay. That's it  That's it. But also shout out bended long really good performance like really good performance nice  I was very impressed without your main bitch. You hate that bitch. Who's my main bitch? Oh, they're from wolf man  Yeah, no, she was fine. I thought she was fine. I think I think it was bad in the movie  I just use a piece  But then they want I thought was like I was more impressed with anybody else  Anyways, I digress  It's a good movie  Chest piece gets fake raped not great so then get raped at all  He puts her in her is fucking truck and he and they're driving back to the house and  He's like fucking hitting her with a stick  He's just funny because like hey chill out. He's just fucking beating the shit over the stick  And like that's not gonna come or down bro  And then he pulls up to the driveway and the hitchhiker is outside  And he says that  Old man gets out of the car and he's pissed because the hitchhiker almost got caught  He's just beating him with the fucking same provision be people of rooms. He was at the cemetery  So I'm led to believe that he's the one grave robbing  Yeah. He's also mad that the Haytech got this brother AKA leather face alone and he asked him to  help him drag Sally into the house and she just this whole time she's just screaming.  Yeah. Like whether the rest of the movies. The rest of the movies, she's just essentially  you're screaming the whole time. But like good screen. Not good. No, it's sound. It's  sell it.  Yeah.  She's a good seller.  Um, so the old man comes inside and he sees the fucking front door, be as much shit out of  their face.  This is my favorite line.  Look what your brother did to the door.  Be the shadow of him.  Any show, uh, live face shows in the freezer to make sure that there's a body in there  and no one got away or whatever.  Um, and then the hitchhiker takes off Sally's fucking bag.  Any ties to this chair and she's where she isn't just fucking again bloody  Myrtle murder should have given back shots.  Hey yo.  Not from this guy.  Never mind.  The old man sends the hitchhiker to get grandpa and he tells Sally making dinner and  the hitchhiker ass, leather face to help him carry grandpa down the stairs.  The two him carry this fucking old ass man and they're fucking rocking chair down the  stairs.  They cut Sally's finger and like rib a suck on it.  Yes, suck that shit.  They're fucking on it.  He's like, yeah.  And she passes out.  And then this scene, I didn't choose between five years.  This scene is what I remember most from the whole movie.  It's so fucking hard.  Yeah.  This is when Leatherface makes his very famous appearance as the pretty lady is.  It's called.  She wakes up and there's just a chicken in front of her as well as like you it's like the POV of the table and  The three of the guys sitting there's like bones and shit everywhere  And grandpa's right next to her and she starts screaming and then they start screaming too  And the lamp  The lamp or the shane of the word we're gonna call is a fucking hay  Yes, skin hay  That's fine kill skinheads. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we're for quality  She begs for her life and then  The hitchhiker calls the old man just the cook and he's like shut you fucking bitch hog  Are you bitch hog?  Okay, I'm the next girl I fuck this slapper over fuck  She's into it I take my juice you bitch. Yeah  Based on bitch ass  The fucking turkey based her out  and  Seminate you the old man doesn't like killing but sometimes just got to do it  It's just what has to be done. Hey, you know, I like doing it, but I like doing it  And then my next note is screaming it's just screaming for a while. Yeah, but like  For long enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Yeah, yeah, it's a very uncomfortable scene this whole time. Yeah, just screaming  I remember there's no music at all. No nothing she's just screaming  The old man tells the little face not to torture her and then the hay tiger calls him a  fucking cook again and then he wants to fucking swing on him.  But then they decide to let grandpa kill Sally because grandpa was the most prolific.  He was the best West.  Yeah.  He was the fucking Tom Brady of killing and slinging dick too.  Yeah, I'm sure back in his day.  The hay-tucker cuts are free and drags are towards fucking grandpa.  She's just screaming for a fucking life.  And they put her hair over a picnic basket.  Okay, Yogi.  This part's kinda funny though.  It's like, it's like you can't do it.  You guys are so fucking like inbred retarded that you didn't think you were gonna fucking  work.  Yeah, I was gonna work.  I mean, grandpa, all this shit, he can't move.  He can't.  He can't fucking hold a goddamn hammer.  I can't permanently grasp it.  He could not.  So he just keeps dropping the hammer.  And then a lot of Facebook wants to help him.  And they kind of get in one strike, kind of.  They show a little blood.  Yeah.  And then the head chuckers like, let me do it.  And Sally's able to break free.  And she runs and chips out this fucking window.  This is a second window she jambed out of.  I was just about to say she's a-  going to say she jumped that other window somewhere and I didn't write down.  Yeah, when she first got on the house, when Leatherface was chasing her, but she jumped  out a second story window that time, snapped her fucking leg.  Uh, and she's running and running and running.  She's for his company.  Uh, and Sawyer and Leatherface Chaser, this scene was scary because she's trying to run  for her life and, uh, home boy, I said Sawyer, that's not right, but the hitchhiker is  like just kind of jalicking behind her and like letting her fucking run.  Yeah, like playing with her hair and shit.  Yeah.  And he's trying to, he's like about the stabber and then he gets fucking hit by like a  16 wheeler.  And it's like really knocking.  Yeah, it's the nominee.  But the effect wasn't great.  It was clear like a dummy.  Yeah.  I didn't hate it.  Okay.  Yeah.  So Sally, the trucker run into the car and then get out of the car on the other side.  And they're trying to evade little to face.  And I found this funny, they just,  those are wrench at lev face.  Yeah, like that falls over.  Falls over the chain saw falls on his leg  and cuts his leg open.  Like gashes his leg a little bit.  It should have gashed it fucking more,  but I think he went.  He went.  Oh!  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, he's retarded.  Uh-oh.  There's another passing by truck that like pulls over  and Sally gets in and the not mean is just left behind.  Fuck him.  Yeah, and she's in the back of the truck and they drive off and she's like screaming and it slowly turns into like kind of a maniacal laugh of like I got away  And I'm gonna live and leather face does his famous chainsaw dance  I thought this dog was not leash, but it does have a leash and there is a owner walking it  It's fucking thrown his chainsaw around  Swork going around  And that is the end of the Texas chainsaw massacre number one. Oh no does oh g  This is the OG. Yeah.  This is a movie that when I I had watched like I said during the pandemic and I didn't watch for the first time  Yeah, and I was like I'm never gonna watch me again because I was disturbed, but also  I hadn't seen shit. I mean think about how many movies I've watched since  2020 that's true. I've seen inside now more than once. I've seen a Serbian film twice  Yeah, terrifying like favorite franchise. Yeah, I've seen the sadness. Yeah  Just like I've seen all good now. Yeah, but also to be honest with you  I don't want to watch this movie like I'm not looking forward to watching it again because the third act is that  fucking menacing and disturbing. Yeah, and it's like that's where like, you know, the whole  Inspiration from this movie comes from it was really like one of the first to like do that  We're like if you if you watch like if you just walk into a random theater in 1974 you know nothing about it  You could think this is like fucking real footage, you know  Yeah, well, I thought it was a fucking true story tomorrow  I'm a fucking idiot. That's a moment. You know they tell you it is at the beginning  But also also I just like how many movies do you watch even today with how desensitized we are  That you're like that's gonna fucking stick with me for a long time  the one I just watched.  Yeah, and it's like that and like a Serbian film.  And like for me, it would be funny games.  As far as disturbing.  I can't, and then like, I mean, there's only one other one,  but it's because the whole genre bothers me.  It's like, I spit in your grave because  rape and rape like really doesn't.  I don't like that.  It doesn't.  You're supposed to not.  Yeah, I mean, we're never gonna cover a rape revenge movie  on this podcast, I don't think.  Maybe it's just not, I mean, I get that it fits our humor,  But that's how much we don't actually like it.  Right.  Just not.  And most of them don't have any redeeming qualities.  No.  I mean, the remake of Ice Betting your Grave,  that kills the end, you could argue are cool.  But it's essentially like a Saw movie.  Yeah, that's not good.  No.  Also, they just, as far as that movie is concerned,  they just go in on her for so fucking long,  that it's like, yeah.  Yeah.  You've got raped.  Like, we just move out the storyline here.  It just like goes way too far.  Yeah.  And like last half of the left for me is just a bad movie.  I just don't like it.  It's uncomfortable on top of being a bad movie.  Not like you're doing that.  Yeah.  You know, I also just thought of that would probably  serve me for a while is that scene in Pink flamingos.  I mean, I say that scene.  There's like several scenes.  Yeah, which one?  I mean, fucking homie getting mama head.  Oh, that was fucking insane.  And his mama.  And then the other scene I would say is the guy  flaring his asshole. Yeah, those both just like, yeah,  her eating shit at the end didn't really bother me as much.  No, because also like, that was like a thing where like we all  like people knew that was going to happen to. Yeah. Like you  could hurt the movie or whatever. Right. And then we had seen  so much at that point when she ate the shit I was like, okay,  I get it. What else could you do? Like just what it is, you  give oral sex on a criteria on blue rig. Like, yeah, you get  Yeah, incest. I mean it's not actually incest but in the storyline it's incest. Yeah, she's sucking her son's cock  That's what it's taking a lot. I wrote that in my American guinea pig review  I'm like I'm getting too far. How the fuck did you even get to that? I don't know man  Yeah, you go nuts and fucking I mean obviously it was fake but under films put it out on Blu-ray  It's the same people that put out Serbian film so I was like I'll check it out  So yeah, check out our one year anniversary on a Serbian film.  That's what the mystery movie is.  You didn't listen to it yet.  Rough listen.  Trigger a little bit.  Rough listen, but honestly a good recording on our end.  Sure.  Then we did a good job.  If I didn't say it, I was tempted to drop this  to a four and a half because I do feel like  there's a low-bend the notes, kind of a fucking drag.  But I'm gonna keep it at five stars.  This is an iconic movie.  This is the most important thing for the rest of my life  as far as like, horrifying.  Like I can go watch any fucking movie  and go to say, you can be fine.  This movie's like fucking wild to me.  Yes, this is a goat.  Go for it. It did all time.  It stands the test of time, which has a lot.  It's a five star for me as well.  One of the greatest horror movies ever made,  and that's just fact.  That's just something where I'm not gonna change my rating  from when I first got letterbox  and just marked movies.
